These experiences made St Francis grow in his passionate love of the poor and crucified Christ, until his complete conformity with Him on La Verna. The strong experience of God as Father and the Highest Good characterized the life of St Francis. It moved him to an attitude towards the Creator of gratitude and praise for His wonders and made him a brother to all people and to all creatures.\n<br/><br/>\nThe gift given to St Francis was that of beginning to do penance. This then involved a process of continuing conversion which changed to sweetness those things which before had seemed bitter. St Francis was in due course led to forsake the mentality and attitudes of this world, to despoil himself of his possessions and of himself in order to pass from a life centered on himself to a gradual conformity with Christ (cf. Test 1.3-4).\n<br/><br/>\nThe path followed by St Francis is a model for the life and formation of us Franciscans today, for we too are called to walk along the same road until we achieve the full stature of Christ (cf. Eph 4,13).\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n</td>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</tr></table>\n\n<h2>Principles of Franciscan Formation</h2>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<h3>General Principles</h3>\n\nThe Franciscan, under the grace of the Holy Spirit, is the chief protagonist of his or her own formation, responsible for accepting and making his own all the values of Franciscan life, capable of making his own decisions and exercising personal initiative.\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is a dynamic process of growth in which we open our heart to the Gospel in our daily life and commit ourselves fully to being continually converted so as to follow Jesus Christ ever more faithfully in the spirit of St Francis.\n<br/><br/>\nThe process of formation respects our unique individuality and the mystery that we bear in ourselves through our particular gifts, encouraging us to grow through knowing ourselves and discovering the will of God.\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation takes place in our Fraternity and in the real world. It is here that we experience the power of grace, are renewed in mind and heart, and develop our evangelizing vocation. Such Franciscan formation is ever alert to our human, Christian, and Franciscan growth, in order that we may follow Jesus Christ wholeheartedly, after the manner of Francis.\n\n\n</td>¸<td width=\"%50\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n\n<h3>Specific Principles</h3>\nFranciscan formation stresses elements of our Franciscan charism (prayerfulness, simplicity, humility, an awe of creation, penitential, and working for social justice and peace)\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is holistic, that is to say it takes into account our whole person, in order that we may develop harmoniously our physical, mental, moral, and intellectual gifts, and may integrate ourselves positively in social and community life\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is a journey during which the fundamental aspects of our consecrated life are cultivated. Hence all formation activities have as their goal growth in the spirit of prayer and contemplation, of brotherhood, minority, service and mission\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is experiential, that is to say it is based on the particular life and gifts of each person, and encourages the concrete experience of the particular Franciscan style and values in the daily life of the Fraternity and of the individual\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is practical, inasmuch as it aims at transforming into action whatever is learned (cf. Adm 7), especially by means of a constant habit of poverty and work, based on the example of St Francis (cf. Test 24)\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is to change behaviour in the conditions of the life, the environment and the time in which it is carried out, while remaining faithful to the Gospel and to the traditions of the Order\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is open to new forms of life and service, since it is continually attentive to the present appeals of the world and the Church\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is organized in stages which involve the person from the beginning of the vocation process and on throughout life.\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is organic, gradual and consistent in its various stages, inasmuch as it promotes the development of each person in a harmonious and progressive way, while fully respecting each individual\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation dedicates adequate time to study, allowing for the particular gifts of each person and without forgetting that learning is not limited to the intellectual dimension of the person, to enable the person to reach an ever fuller knowledge of God and the better to serve everyone\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation promotes an authentic sense of discipline directed to an honest self- knowledge and self-control, to fraternal life and to service.\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[FOEN] Formation','','publish','closed','closed','','formation','','','2020-10-02 11:22:29','2020-10-02 15:22:29','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=70',0,'page','',0),(72,1,'2020-09-25 17:02:10','2020-09-25 21:02:10','Formation Placeholder','Formation','','inherit','closed','closed','','70-revision-v1','','','2020-09-25 17:02:10','2020-09-25 21:02:10','',70,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/25/70-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(75,1,'2020-09-25 17:03:20','2020-09-25 21:03:20','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Social Justice and Integrity of Creation JPIC</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":539,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/JPIC-Resources-One.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-539\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<h2>Justice Peace and Integrity of Creation</h2>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">And what does the Lord require of you? \n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/JPIC-Resources-Two.png\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\">\nTo act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.”\n (Micah 6:8) \n<br>\n<br>\nBlessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.”\n (Matthew 5:9)\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Lord God took man and settled him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and take care of it” (Gen 2:15)\n<br>\n<br></div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong>JUSTICE, PEACE AND INTEGRITY OF CREATION </strong><br>\nAdopted from National Fraternity of Canada\n<br>\n<strong>The Basis of Franciscan JPIC \nconcern and action</strong><br>\n\n<strong>The basis of Franciscan justice, peace and integrity of creation (JPIC)</strong><br>\nconcern and action is the Bible, Catholic Social Doctrine/Teaching, Franciscan Tradition and Spirituality, the OFS Rule and General Constitutions, reading the “signs of the times” and the Catholic Action model of “See, Judge, Act.” Franciscan values for 800 years have been: poverty, simplicity, humility, justice, peace, joy in God, universal brotherhood and kinship with creation.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>An OFS Presence in the World</strong><br>\nIn March 2003, the International Council of the OFS (CIOFS) established the Presence in the World Commission (PIWC) to respond to the Conclusions of the 2002 General Chapter regarding the presence of Secular Franciscans in the world. This presence includes activity in the field of JPIC. The OFS General Chapter, 2008 in its’ conclusions stated: “For too long, the Order has not fully entered into its active mission in the world.  The moment has come, and it can no longer be deferred, to “enter the city,” to exercise with determination and full visibility its own responsibilities to witness, and to promote justice, peace, human rights and the integrity of creation”. \n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Parrhesia</strong> means to speak clearly and boldly without fear or hesitation. Benedetto Lino, ofs, (a CIOFS Presidency Councillor) wrote this about parrhesia recently: “Today, more than ever, we should ask the Lord for the grace of parrhesia, for each one of us, for the whole SFO [sic] and for our churches.” Parrhesia applies to all JPIC activity and especially to Franciscan Voice Canada (see below n. 8).\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>OFS Rule and General Constitutions</strong> <br>\nThe OFS Rule (nn.13-19) and the OFS General Constitutions (“For a Just and Fraternal Society” nn. 18-23) form the OFS basis of the JPIC “holy activity” mentioned by Our Seraphic Father Francis (Later Adm &amp; Exhort 51-53).  The Rule and General Constitutions are in turn grounded on the basic principles of Catholic Social Doctrine e.g. human dignity; the common good; the preferential option for the poor; agápe/caritas/love and peace; solidarity; and the sacramentality, integrity and stewardship of creation\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\"><strong>TRILLIUM REGIONAL FRATERNITY \n JUSTICE, PEACE AND INTEGRITY OF CREATION</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Franciscan Tradition and Spirituality</strong><br>\nFranciscan tradition and spirituality leads us to put life before profit, to struggle for justice and peace, and to care for creation. This is at the heart of our Franciscan charism, experience and holy activity. Francis and Clare refused to be bound by the values of a merchant society based on profit at the cost of the exploitation and marginalisation of the poor. Following the poor Jesus, they lead an alternative counter-cultural life based on solidarity with the lepers, the poor and the marginalised (the minores) and also with nature, a gift from God, with whom we have kinship as the Canticle of the Creatures and OFS Rule attest. We can say that Francis and Clare responded to the “Cry of the earth and Cry of the poor” and that they also discerned a “cry for peace” and sought right relationships and were peacemakers. \n<br>\n<br>\nStill today the enemies of justice, peace and good stewardship of creation are greed, lust for power and ignorance. To emulate Francis and Clare currently requires concrete choices and action in a commercially globalised world. Implementation of this JPIC Action Plan will lead to contemporary ways in which we can follow Francis and Clare in a practical and concrete manner.\nThe OFS, in order to follow the Rule, has a prophetic mission to make it a priority in its’ fraternal and individuals’ lives to raise their own and others’ awareness of, and act for, JPIC.  Our JPIC plans and actions should reflect our belief that in addressing systemic injustice, which is the root cause of so much poverty and pain in our world, we will bring hope and positive change into the lives of those who suffer most.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe need to understand the link between faith, charity, justice and stewardship; to develop the habit of analysis of political, social and economic issues (see, judge and act) in light of the social doctrine of the church in order to arrive at clear conclusions; and to take pertinent action ourselves and in collaboration with partner organizations and especially to advocate for the voiceless and un-empowered (the minores).</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong>JPIC Resources</strong><br><br>\n<a href=\"/index.php/en/jpic-issues-resources/\">JPIC Resources</a><br><br>\n<strong>GREAT SOURCES FOR Resources, Issues and Materials contact:</strong><br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.franciscanvoicecanada.com/\">FRANCISCAN VOICE CANADA</a><br><br><br>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/35Hmgn5mTGs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[SJEN] Social Justice JPIC','','publish','closed','closed','','social-justice-jpic','','','2020-10-14 11:55:50','2020-10-14 15:55:50','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=75',0,'page','',0),(76,1,'2020-09-25 17:03:20','2020-09-25 21:03:20','Social Justice Placeholder','Social Justice JPIC','','inherit','closed','closed','','75-revision-v1','','','2020-09-25 17:03:20','2020-09-25 21:03:20','',75,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/25/75-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(77,1,'2020-09-28 16:42:39','2020-09-28 20:42:39','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Programs</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[PREN] Programs','','publish','closed','closed','','pren-programs','','','2020-09-28 16:42:40','2020-09-28 20:42:40','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=77',0,'page','',0),(78,1,'2020-09-25 17:04:53','2020-09-25 21:04:53','Programs Placeholder','Programs','','inherit','closed','closed','','77-revision-v1','','','2020-09-25 17:04:53','2020-09-25 21:04:53','',77,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/25/77-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(81,1,'2020-09-28 16:23:10','2020-09-28 20:23:10','<h1>Resources</h1>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[REEN] Resources','','publish','closed','closed','','reen-resources','','','2020-09-28 16:23:10','2020-09-28 20:23:10','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=81',0,'page','',0),(82,1,'2020-09-25 17:05:32','2020-09-25 21:05:32','Resources','Resources','','inherit','closed','closed','','81-revision-v1','','','2020-09-25 17:05:32','2020-09-25 21:05:32','',81,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/25/81-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(87,1,'2020-09-25 17:09:49','2020-09-25 21:09:49','','Social Justice JPIC','','publish','closed','closed','','87','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=87',19,'nav_menu_item','',0),(91,1,'2020-09-25 17:10:23','2020-09-25 21:10:23','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Who We Are</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Secular Franciscans are people who seek to follow Jesus in the footsteps of St. Francis, who made Christ the inspiration and the centre of his life.

As a lay order, we are not called to leave the world, but to transform it.&nbsp;Our Order has fraternities at the Local, Regional, National and International levels with duly elected councils.&nbsp;The Franciscan Spirit of poverty, simplicity, service and joy runs through the whole Franciscan family; (that is, the First Order, priests and brothers; Second Order, the Poor Clares, cloistered nuns; Third Order Regular, brothers and sisters; and the Seculars; who used to be called the Third Order).&nbsp;This spirit is called the Franciscan Charism. (Charism; meaning a gift given by the Holy Spirit to help with the task of building up the Church).<br><br><strong>GOSPEL LIVING&nbsp;</strong>Our vocation is to make Sacred Scripture the basis for our life, especially the Gospel, following Jesus Christ closely in the spirit of St. Francis. This vocation of Secular Franciscans, calls them to make profession in the Secular Franciscan Order, which is \"on a par with\" and \"of equal importance to\" profession made by friars or any religious.<br><br><strong>FRATERNITY&nbsp;</strong>We are sisters and brothers in Christ. The fraternity to which we belong is the privileged place where we develop our sense of Church, Franciscan spirituality and ministry. Meetings are held monthly for prayer, study, sharing and to fraternize. We seek to encounter the living person of Christ in each other, in Scripture and Liturgical prayer and in the Sacraments.<br><br><strong>CONVERSION&nbsp;</strong>The Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ spoke to Francis, and Francis truly heard. He turned from a life of comfort and self indulgence to a life of ongoing conversion and service. Inspired by this radical change in Francis; Clare of Assisi left wealth and family to find the truth of the Gospel way of life. We too strive daily to abandon ourselves to God’s plan for our lives.<br></td><td><strong>SIMPLICITY&nbsp;</strong>Secular Franciscans seek to live simply, valuing the goodness of creation, and sharing their love for God with others. St. Francis was known to revere all creation as originating from our loving God. As God’s stewards of creation, our work is to foster a love for the sacredness of all life, to relinquish the desire to accumulate goods and the power of possessions, and to find joy in the abundance of God rather than the empty promises of the world.<br><br><strong>SOCIAL JUSTICE&nbsp;</strong>Secular Franciscan brothers and sisters seek to respond to the Gospel challenge through the witness of their lives, identifying with the poor and the needy, and promoting social justice in response to the call to the mission of the Church.<br><br><strong>PEACE AND PENANCE&nbsp;</strong>Adopting Saints Francis and Clare as models, Secular Franciscans work ardently for peace and reconciliation in their families, churches, communities, schools, work places... in all corners of the world.&nbsp;We value the integrity of family life as a sign in the world of peace, fidelity and respect for life.&nbsp;We esteem work as a gift through which we share in creation, redemption and service to the human family.&nbsp;We are actively involved in the sacramental life of the church and reaching out to community life in service, love and the building of God’s kingdom.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->','[WOEN] Who We Are','','publish','closed','closed','','who-we-are','','','2020-09-29 14:46:41','2020-09-29 18:46:41','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=91',0,'page','',0),(92,1,'2020-09-25 17:10:23','2020-09-25 21:10:23','Who We Are Placeholder','Who We Are','','inherit','closed','closed','','91-revision-v1','','','2020-09-25 17:10:23','2020-09-25 21:10:23','',91,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/25/91-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(93,1,'2020-09-25 17:16:08','2020-09-25 21:16:08','','Who We Are','','publish','closed','closed','','93','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=93',2,'nav_menu_item','',0),(95,1,'2020-09-25 17:23:08','2020-09-25 21:23:08','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Franciscan Spirituality</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When people think of Franciscan Spirituality they think either of love of animals/creation or being a peacemaker.

The Friars, Poor Clare nuns, Sisters and Brothers of the Third Order and Secular Franciscans all profess to live the Gospel.&nbsp;\n<br />\nArticle 4 of the Rule of the Secular Franciscan Order states:&nbsp;\n<br />\nThe rule and life of the Secular Franciscans is this: to observe the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ by following the example of Saint Francis of Assisi, who made Christ the inspiration and the center of his life with God and people. Christ, the gift of the Father\'s love, is the way to him, the truth into which the Holy Spirit leads us, and the life which he has come to give abundantly.\n<br />\nSecular Franciscans should devote themselves especially to careful reading of the gospel, going from gospel to life and life to the gospel\n\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From the earliest days of the Franciscan movement the word ‘penance’ had </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>a special meaning.

What Francis meant by it is, the biblical understanding of a total turning to God. This is what Jesus was referring to when he said: “Repent, for the Kingdom of God is at hand.” Repent means change. Change, for the kingdom of God is at hand.

It concerns the commandment to love your neighbour as your self. This is easier if you like your neighbour. But what if your neighbour is unlovable? For Francis this was the leper. How could he strive to live out this commandment and yet despise the leper? God lead him to love and care for the leper.\n<br>\nThis is what Francis wrote in his Testament:\n<br>\nThe Lord granted me, Brother Francis, to begin to do penance in this way: While I was in sin, it seemed very bitter to me to see lepers. And the Lord Himself led me among them and I had mercy upon them. And when I left them that which seemed bitter to me was changed into sweetness of soul and body; and afterward I lingered a little and left the world.\n<br>\nThomas of Celano, the first biographer of St Francis, tells us that Francis could not stand the sight of a leper. Even if he saw the leprosarium in the distance he would hold his nose and ride in the other direction. All that changed one day. As he rode down the path deep in thought when suddenly, a leper appeared before him begging alms. Francis nevertheless got down from his horse and kissed the leper. When his kiss was returned, Francis was filled with joy. As he rode off, he turned around for a last wave, and saw that the leper had disappeared. He always looked upon it as a test from God.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":388,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jesus_Heals_Leper.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-388\"/><figcaption>Jesus Heals the Leper</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->','[TLEN] The Leper','','publish','closed','closed','','the-leper','','','2020-09-29 15:09:27','2020-09-29 19:09:27','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=104',0,'page','',0),(105,1,'2020-09-28 12:33:54','2020-09-28 16:33:54','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Leper Placeholder</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','The Leper','','inherit','closed','closed','','104-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 12:33:54','2020-09-28 16:33:54','',104,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/104-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(107,1,'2020-09-28 12:34:35','2020-09-28 16:34:35','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>The Sultan</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Sultan-One.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\" />Six years before his death, Francis goes to the Egypt to meet the Sultan, the leader of the enemies of the Cross of Christ. We might say he goes to meet enemy number one. Francis goes to live out the command of Jesus that we are to love our enemies, to pray for those who persecute us. In Francis own writing he recalls that Jesus called his betrayer, Judas – a friend. And that Jesus prayed for those who put him to death, asking the Father to forgive them. If Jesus did this then so must he. So Francis goes to Egypt to meet his enemy, to make his enemy his friend. Amazingly he does just that.\n<br /><br />\nFrancis went to Egypt where the forces of Christendom faced the forces of the Muslems at the port city of Damiatta. After asking the Christian commander to stop the fighting, which the commander refused to do, Francis and a companiom, Brother Illuminatus, set out, unarmed to see the Sultan of Egypt, Malik-al-Kamil. The men of the Sultan’s army captured Francis and his companion and dragged them, beaten and exhausted, before the Sultan.\n<br /><br />\nSt. Bonaventure, in his Major Life of St. Francis, described the event, “The Sultan asked them by whom and why and in what capacity they had been sent, and how they got there; but Francis replied that they had been sent by God, not by men, to show him and his subjects the way of salvation and proclaim the truth of the Gospel message. When the sultan saw his enthusiasm and courage, he listened to him willingly and pressed him to stay with him.”\n<br /><br />\nIn the encounter between them, both Francis and the Sultan were changed. When Francis finally left to return to Italy, the Sultan showered him with many gifts and treasures. Because he had no interest in worldly wealth, Francis refused them all, except one special gift: an ivory horn used by the muezzin to call the faithful to prayer. On his return, Francis used it to call people for prayer or for preaching.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":392,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Sultan-Two.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392\"/><figcaption>The Sultan</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[TSEN] The Sultan','','publish','closed','closed','','the-sultan','','','2020-09-29 15:16:20','2020-09-29 19:16:20','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=107',0,'page','',0),(108,1,'2020-09-28 12:34:35','2020-09-28 16:34:35','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Sultan Placeholder</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','The Sultan','','inherit','closed','closed','','107-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 12:34:35','2020-09-28 16:34:35','',107,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/107-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(110,1,'2020-09-28 12:35:12','2020-09-28 16:35:12','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>A Dwelling Place</h1> \n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/A-Dwelling-Place.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\">\nAn important aspect of Franciscan Spirituality is to make room for God in our lives. In the Early Rule of 1221 for the Friars, Francis wrote these words: \n<br>\n<br>\n“Within our hearts we must make a home and dwelling place for God our Lord, the almighty Father, the Son and Holy Spirit. God is always near us, and in prayer we consciously think of God, we place ourselves in his presence. Francis tells us it is the opposite. We must make a presence - a home for God in our hearts so that we may carry him with us always.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThere is an interesting reflection on making a home, a dwelling place for God. \n<br>\n<br>\nLuke 11:24-26 When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest; and finding none he says, `I will return to my house from which I came.\' And when he comes he finds it swept and put in order. Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrancis reminds us that It is not good enough to just banish evil thoughts and habits, “to hate ones body with its vice” as he says in his Letter to all the Faithful. It isn’t sufficient to just clean one’s house. We must also fill the void with God who is the source of all that is good and upright. We must make a home and dwelling place for God.\n<br>\n<br>\nFranciscan Spirituality is centred on three key mysteries of our Faith. These mysteries Francis meditated on frequently. They are the Incarnation, the Paschal Mystery and the Eucharist. We might say the crib, the cross and the Mass.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[ADEN] A Dwelling Place','','publish','closed','closed','','a-dwelling-place','','','2020-10-14 09:31:51','2020-10-14 13:31:51','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=110',0,'page','',0),(111,1,'2020-09-28 12:35:12','2020-09-28 16:35:12','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A Dwelling Place Placeholder</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','A Dwelling Place','','inherit','closed','closed','','110-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 12:35:12','2020-09-28 16:35:12','',110,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/110-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(113,1,'2020-09-28 12:35:56','2020-09-28 16:35:56','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Three Key Mysteries</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Three-Key-Mysteries-One.jpeg\" style=\"float:left; padding-right:20px;\" />Lets first look at the Incarnation. St Francis is responsible for the popularity of Christmas Midnight Mass and Nativities scenes in Churches and homes. St Francis of Assisi was so taken by the mystery of the Incarnation that he wanted to present it anew in a living Nativity scene, He is perhaps the first to have a live nativity scene with animals and people playing the part of Mary, Joseph, the shepherds and wise men. This happened near the town of Greccio three years before his death. St. Bonaventure in his Life of St. Francis of Assisi tells the story the best:\n<br />\n<br />\n“He wanted to commemorate the nativity of the Infant Jesus with great devotion, he prepared a manger, and brought hay, and an ox and an ass to the place appointed. The brethren were summoned, the people ran together, the forest resounded with their voices, and that venerable night was made glorious by many and brilliant lights and sonorous psalms of praise. The man of God [St. Francis] stood before the manger, full of devotion and piety, bathed in tears and radiant with joy; the Holy Gospel was chanted by Francis. Then he preached to the people about the nativity of the poor and humble King; and being unable to utter His name for the tenderness of His love, He called Him the Babe of Bethlehem. A certain valiant soldier, Master John of Greccio, affirmed that he beheld an Infant marvellously beautiful, sleeping in the manger, whom the blessed Father Francis embraced with both his arms, as if he would awake Him from sleep. This vision of the devout soldier is credible”.</p>\n<p>a humble stable. Even today nativities scenes and pageants still touch the hearts of all who see them\nPicture\nThe Paschal Mystery.  We adore You,  O Christ and we praise you, because by your cross You have redeemed the world.” Most of us will recognize this pray as part of the Stations of the Cross. It actual is a shorten form of a prayer by St. Francis. We find it in his Testament. “The Lord gave me such faith in churches that I would simply pray and speak in this way: we adore You, Lord Jesus Christ, in all Your Churches throughout the world, and we bless You, for through Your holy Cross You have redeemed the world.”  When Francis meditated on the Cross: \"His whole soul seemed to melt away; and so deeply was the memory of Christ\'s Passion impressed on his heart, that it pierced even to the marrow of his bones. From that hour, whenever he thought of the Passion of Christ he could scarcely restrain his tears and sighs.\"\n\nCelano relates, \"From that hour he was pierced with compassion for the Crucified Saviour, so that for the rest of his life he bore in his heart the holy wounds, which later were also impressed upon his body. The sufferings of Christ were ever before his eyes, and filled them with ever-flowing tears.\"<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Three-Key-Mysteries-Two.jpeg\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\"></p>\n<p>Two years before his death after a retreat of many weeks meditating on the love of Christ in the Passion Francis was mark with the sacred wounds of Christ the stigmata. Christ appeared to him as a six wing saraph. Francis through his daily meditations on the cross was able to live out the words of St. Paul “ May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal 6,14). Franciscan spirituality encourages us to do the same.</p><br />\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Three-Key-Mysteries-Three.jpeg\" style=\"float:left; padding-right:20px;\" />Eucharist is amazing how often Francis mentioned the Eucharist in his letters. Whether he was writing to Rulers, the Friars or the brothers and sisters of penance he encouraged all to receive the Eucharist. In the Rule of 1221 Francis tells the friars: “let them receive the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ with great humility and veneration, calling to mind what the Lord Himself says: ‘He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and do this in memory of me.” \n<br />\n<br />\nNear the end of his life, when he was unable to attend the General Chapter he sent these words to the friars. “I conjure you all, brothers, kissing your feet and with the charity of which I am capable, to show all reverence and honour possible to the most holy body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the things that are in heaven and the things that are on earth are pacified and reconciled to almighty God”. St Francis in his own time encouraged people to have a greater devotion and understanding of the Eucharist in these short few words.  \"Every fiber of the heart of Francis was aglow with love for the sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ.  He considered it an unpardonable negligence not to attend Mass each day whenever possible.  If he could not make it to Mass due to illness he would have the Gospel of the day read to him.  If I can not be present at Mass, I adore the Body of Christ in adoration and with the eyes of the soul\". </p>\n<p>I think each of us can understand the humility of God both in the Incarnation in the Passion. “And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death – even death on the cross” (Phil 2:8). What is most interesting is that Francis adds the Eucharist to his mediations on the humility of God. Francis was profoundly struck by the humility of Jesus who, for love of humanity, deigned to be with us under the appearance of bread and wine. He wrote in the 1st Admonition: “Behold, each day He humbles Himself as when he came from the royal throne into the Virgin’s womb; each day He Himself comes to us, appearing humbly; each day He comes down from the bosom of the Father upon the altar in the hands of a priest. As He revealed Himself to the holy apostles in true flesh, so He reveals Himself to us now in sacred bread. And as they saw only His flesh by an insight of their flesh, yet believed that He was God as they contemplated Him with their spiritual eyes, let us, as we see bread and wine with our bodily eyes, see and firmly believe that they are His most holy Body and Blood living and true.\n<br />\n<br />\n\nFor Francis the Eucharist is the continuation in time of the mystery of Christ, begun at the Incarnation, reaching climax at the Paschal Mystery and continuing in the Eucharist – the crib, the cross, and the Eucharist. The Eucharist is the poverty of Christ continued in time. In his Letter to a Chapter, we see that the Eucharist symbolized for Francis the complete self-giving of Christ.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\"Let the whole of mankind tremble, the whole world shake and the heavens exult when Christ, the Son of the living God, is [present] on the altar in the hands of a priest. O admirable heights and sublime lowliness! O sublime humility! O humble sublimity! That the Lord of the universe, God and the Son of God, so humbles Himself that for our salvation He hides Himself under the little form of Bread! Look, brothers, at the humility of God and pour out your heart before Him! Humble yourselves, as well, that you may be exalted by Him. Therefore hold back nothing of yourselves for yourselves so that He who gives Himself totally to you may receive you totally\".\n<br />\n<br />\nFrancis wanted to die at the Portiuncula, the little church of St Mary of the Angel, the little portion of heaven. He wanted to give up the breath of life where he had first experienced the breath of Grace. As he lay dying he asked that the Gospel of John chapter 13 be read. We hear this Gospel every Holy Thursday. It is about Jesus washing the feet of his disciples.\n<br />\n<br />\nDo you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord—and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example that you also should do as I have done to you”. (John 13:12-15)\n<br />\n<br />\nAs he was dying he told the friars who were present: “I have done my part, may Christ teach you to do yours”.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n<strong>“The Exhortation of our Blessed Father Francis”</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>O most beloved Friars and Sons forever blessed,</strong>\n<strong>hear me; hear the voice of your father.</strong>\n<strong>Great things we have promised;</strong>\n<strong>Greater have been promised us.</strong>\n<strong>Let us observe the former:</strong>\n<strong>Let us aspire to the latter.</strong>\n<strong>Pleasure is slight; glory, infinite.</strong>\n<strong>Many are called; few are chosen; retribution for all.</strong>\n<strong>Brethren, while we have time, let us do good.</strong>\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[TKEN] Three Key Mysteries','','publish','closed','closed','','three-key-mysteries','','','2020-09-29 15:51:29','2020-09-29 19:51:29','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=113',0,'page','',0),(114,1,'2020-09-28 12:35:56','2020-09-28 16:35:56','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Three Key Mysteries Placeholder</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Three Key Mysteries','','inherit','closed','closed','','113-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 12:35:56','2020-09-28 16:35:56','',113,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/113-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(115,1,'2020-09-28 12:37:49','2020-09-28 16:37:49','','Three Key Mysteries','','publish','closed','closed','','115','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=115',8,'nav_menu_item','',0),(116,1,'2020-09-28 12:37:49','2020-09-28 16:37:49','','A Dwelling Place','','publish','closed','closed','','116','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=116',7,'nav_menu_item','',0),(117,1,'2020-09-28 12:37:49','2020-09-28 16:37:49','','The Sultan','','publish','closed','closed','','117','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=117',6,'nav_menu_item','',0),(118,1,'2020-09-28 12:37:49','2020-09-28 16:37:49','','The Leper','','publish','closed','closed','','118','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=118',5,'nav_menu_item','',0),(121,1,'2020-09-28 12:38:38','2020-09-28 16:38:38','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>The Life of Saint Francis of Assisi</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Francis-One.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px\" />Francis lived at the turn of the 13th Century, from 1181 to 1226. It was a time of great social, economic, political and religious change. It was a time of the re-emergence of the Merchant class, the Guilds, and a whole new economic system. It was a world of the Lords and the serfs; of haves and have-nots; of the strong and the weak.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike any young man Francis wanted to do something important in his life. His father wanted him to be a cloth merchant like himself and perhaps take over the business one day. Francis dreamed of being a Knight. His father wasn’t apposed to this for if Francis became a knight then the family would move up in social standing. But God had a different plan, a different calling for him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a battle between the neighbour towns of <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/16247551\">Perugia</a> and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/23619028\">Assisi</a> the combatants from Assisi lost. Francis and others were captured and held for ransom. It was a year before his Father finally agreed on a ransom price and paid for his release. This imprisonment change Francis’ life. During his time in prison he began to pray for guidance from God. He continued this after his release. Often he would pray in the small churches in and around Assisi. He left his followers one of his prayers for guidance. It is referred to as the prayer before the crucifix:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:ccenter\">Most High, glorious God,<br/>\nenlighten the darkness of my heart.<br/>\nand give me true faith, certain hope,<br/>\nand perfect charity,... sense and knowledge, Lord,<br/>\nthat I may carry out Your holy and true command.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>After a while others joined him. Bernard of Quintavalle, an aristocrat from the town, was the first to join Francis, and then Peter of Cattane, a well-known canon of the cathedral. So they went to the local church to seek the guidance of the Lord. They prayed and then opened the Book of the Gospels three times. This is what they found:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Francis-Two.jpg\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\" />\n<ul style=\"text-decoration:circle\">\n<li><underline>Matthew 19: 16, 21</underline> Then a young man came and asked, ‘Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life? …If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money* to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.</li>\n<li><underline>Matthew 16: 24</underline> If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</li>\n<li><underline>Luke 14: 26</underline> Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<p>This shall be our rule of life,\" exclaimed Francis, and led his companions to the public square, where they gave away all their belongings to the poor.\n<p>When Francis had about 12 followers he wrote a rule in a few words and went to Rome to have his way of life approved by the Pope. In his Testament St Francis tells us “And after the Lord gave me brothers, no one showed me what I should do, but the Most High Himself revealed to me that I should live according to the form of the Holy Gospel. And I had this written down simply and in a few words and the Lord Pope confirmed it for me. And those who came to receive life gave to the poor everything which they were capable of possessing and they were content with one tunic, patched inside and out, with a cord and short trousers. And we had no desire for anything more”.</p>\nEven today those who wish to join the Friars are asked to sell all they have, give to the poor and come follow Christ.\n<br />\n<br />\nThere is a story that the Pope did not want to approve this way of life for Francis. He asked the friars to come back the next day and he would give his decision. Supposedly he had a dream of the Church of St. John Lateran falling down and then a poor beggar holding up the walls of the church. When he woke he realised the beggar was St Francis and approved his Rule.\n\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[FFEN] The Life of Saint Francis of Assisi','','publish','closed','closed','','the-life-of-saint-francis-of-assisi','','','2020-10-12 12:39:19','2020-10-12 16:39:19','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=121',0,'page','',0),(122,1,'2020-09-28 12:38:38','2020-09-28 16:38:38','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Placeholder</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','The Life of Saint Francis of Assisi','','inherit','closed','closed','','121-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 12:38:38','2020-09-28 16:38:38','',121,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/121-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(124,1,'2020-09-28 13:33:00','2020-09-28 17:33:00','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Clair.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\">Clare was born in 1193 in Assisi, a small town in the scenic Umbrian Valley of Italy. She was born of nobility, the oldest child of Ortulana and Favarone di Offreduccio.  At the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century, Italy was a cauldron of political and military strife. Society was divided into two groups: the maiores and minores. The maiores were the nobility. The minores were former serfs, who had become merchants, craftsmen and field workers. These two groups were continually fighting for power among themselves.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn her early youth, Clare was exiled to Perugia. While the men in the family were off fighting their wars, the women chose to live as penitents. Ortulana, along with her daughters, as well as other women among Clare\'s family and friends, were fasting, praying, bringing food to the poor and visiting prisoners.  This time of suffering and exile became a time of spiritual formation. Many of the women living with Clare in Perugia, including her mother and sisters, later became some of Clare\'s first followers in <a  href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Damiano,_Assisi\">San Damiano</a>.\n</p>\n<p>In 1205, Clare\'s family returned to Assisi. Francis had already begun his conversion. He had publicly renounced his father and started rebuilding San Damiano. In 1208, he began preaching. Clare\'s cousin Rufino became one of his early followers.  Clare\'s household had to have experienced the stir that Francis was causing. An eyewitness, cited in the Acts of the Process of Canonization [of Clare], said that, during this time, Clare went to hear Francis preach, gave him some money to rebuild churches and to feed the poor, and arranged to talk to him in private.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare and Francis were both experiencing God breaking into their lives, changing them and calling them to give themselves over to God. Both were facing unknowns and both were probably frightened and unsure of themselves. It must have been a comforting grace to meet a kindred spirit and to encounter another human being who was experiencing the same call and facing the same doubts. Clare\'s sister Beatrice tells us (in the document of the canonization process) that Francis first initiated the visit with Clare. Some speculation suggests that women were asking to join his movement and Francis needed a strong woman to lead the others.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s reputation for holiness was well known in Assisi. She would be the perfect leader. Who went to whom first is unimportant. The important reality was that God had a plan and that Francis and Clare were open to being led.  Francis and the brothers received Clare on Palm Sunday night at the chapel of <a href=\"https://www.piercedhearts.org/treasures/holy_sites/portiuncula.htm\">St. Mary of the Angels (the Portiuncula)</a> in the year 1212. Shortly after this, she was taken to San Paolo, a Benedictine monastery in Bastia.  The men in Clare\'s family were not happy with her following Francis. Their power and wealth were diminishing with the changes in society. Clare was beautiful and they had hoped that her marriage would bring prestige and continued wealth into the family. They followed her to San Paolo with every intention of bringing her home.  Clare instead held on to the altar and claimed sanctuary. She had made her choice. She would never turn back.  Clare\'s sister Catherine, soon to be called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Assisi\">Agnes</a>, joined Clare. The two lived for a while with a group of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beguines_and_Beghards\">Beguines</a> (13th-century women under vows) in Sant\'Angelo in Panzo until Francis brought them to the church of San Damiano. There, the Lord gave them sisters and their community grew quickly.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s community was to be vastly different from the monastic communities of her time. The sisters were to live poorly without large land holdings. Like Francis, their Rule would be to embrace the gospel form of life. They would all be of equal rank, and all decisions affecting their life would be made by all of them.  They would have an abbess, but she would consider herself \"the servant of the sisters\" and she would lead more by her example of virtue than by instruction or admonition.  Clare was the perfect follower of Francis. She understood his message and would spend her entire life making it a lived reality. Her life and the lives of the early sisters, however, were not easy ones.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrancis died young. Clare outlived him by 27 years. She remained firm and kept the ideal alive, despite Francis\' absence and the dissension among his brothers. The Church would see the poverty of her life as too difficult. She negotiated with popes and worked to get her Rule approved until the day before she died—August 10, 1253.\nWithin the context of the medieval world of the 13th century, Clare lived and struggled with many of the issues that are present in our day. She was a woman of strength and courage, of wisdom and insight, of patience and with an innate gift of leadership. Looking closely at her, we can learn much about the response to life that enables us to be free in a world where oppression abounds. As a medieval woman born into a rich and powerful family, her role in life was defined for her when she was still a child by the men who ruled the clan. She would be married to a man of their choosing, someone whose assets and social standing would make the clan even more powerful. Her wishes were considered irrelevant, until the day she sold her inheritance, instantly making her worthless in the marriage market.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s society was rigidly stratified. She broke down those class structures by insisting that everyone work with their hands and that everyone was equal in every way. Without hesitation, she swept away all the artificial class distinctions that society had created and which led to wars and violence. Clare has much to teach us about living together on our planet earth as sisters and brothers, all children of the one God.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare understood the links between money and power. Economic freedom equals social freedom which in this context paves the way for spiritual freedom. Clare\'s life of absolute poverty cuts through all the enticements of our consumerist culture. Clare exhorted her sisters who served outside the monastery to: Praise God for every green and flowering plant that you see; for every human person and for every creature. The environmental crisis is the result of a lack of care and reverence for the good things that God has given us for our use and our happiness. In beholding a flower, a sunset, the vast ocean, the varieties of animals, the sun, moon, stars, human beings so often fail to see, as Clare did, the reflection of a loving Creator of all these wonders.\n<br>\n<br>\nHer wisdom and holiness were recognized far and wide, and Popes and prelates came to her to recommend themselves to her prayer. In our contemporary world, women all over the globe are experiencing their worth and dignity in a new way and are struggling to resist the forces of oppression and domination which perpetuate the evil of unhealthy dependence. In this struggle Clare has much to teach all of us.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare is as relevant today as she was in the thirteenth century. Perhaps even more so because like all holy people, she was a prophet whose message is timeless.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Clair-Two.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[FCEN] The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi','','publish','closed','closed','','the-life-of-saint-clare-of-assisi','','','2020-10-12 12:55:21','2020-10-12 16:55:21','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=124',0,'page','',0),(125,1,'2020-09-28 13:33:00','2020-09-28 17:33:00','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Placeholder</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi','','inherit','closed','closed','','124-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 13:33:00','2020-09-28 17:33:00','',124,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/124-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(127,1,'2020-09-28 13:33:52','2020-09-28 17:33:52','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Life of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Elizabeth-of-Hungary-One.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\">\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Hungary#:~:text=Elizabeth%20of%20Hungary%20%28%20German%3A%20Heilige%20Elisabeth%20von,by%20which%20she%20is%20honored%20as%20its%20patroness\">Elizabeth</a> was born in 1207; historians dispute her birthplace. Her father was Andrew II, the rich and powerful King of Hungary. To reinforce political ties he had married the German Countess Gertrude of Andechs-Meran, sister of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedwig_of_Silesia\">St Hedwig</a> who was wife to the Duke of Silesia. Elizabeth, together with her sister and three brothers, spent only the first four years of her childhood at the Hungarian court. She liked playing, music and dancing; she recited her prayers faithfully and already showed special attention to the poor, whom she helped with a kind word or an affectionate gesture.\n<br>\n<br>\nHer happy childhood was suddenly interrupted when some knights arrived from distant Thuringia to escort her to her new residence in Central Germany. In fact, complying with the customs of that time, Elizabeth\'s father had arranged for her to become a Princess of Thuringia. The Landgrave or Count of this region was one of the richest and most influential sovereigns in Europe at the beginning of the 13th century and his castle was a centre of magnificence and culture.\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, the festivities and apparent glory concealed the ambition of feudal princes who were frequently warring with each other and in conflict with the royal and imperial authorities. In this context the Landgrave Hermann very willingly accepted the betrothal of his son Ludwig to the Hungarian Princess. Elizabeth left her homeland with a rich dowry and a large entourage, including her personal ladies-in-waiting, two of whom were to remain faithful friends to the very end. It is they who left us the precious information on the childhood and life of the Saint.\n<br>\n<br>\nThey reached Eisenach after a long journey and made the ascent to the Fortress of Wartburg, the strong castle towering over the city. It was here that the betrothal of Ludwig and Elizabeth was celebrated. In the ensuing years, while Ludwig learned the knightly profession, Elizabeth and her companions studied German, French, Latin, music, literature and embroidery. Despite the fact that political reasons had determined their betrothal, a sincere love developed between the two young people, enlivened by faith and by the desire to do God’s will. On his father\'s death when Ludwig was 18 years old, he began to reign over Thuringia. Elizabeth, however, became the object of critical whispers because her behaviour was incongruous with court life. Hence their marriage celebrations were far from sumptuous and a part of the funds destined for the banquet was donated to the poor.\n<br>\n<br>\nWith her profound sensitivity, Elizabeth saw the contradictions between the faith professed and Christian practice. She could not bear compromise. Once, on entering a church on the Feast of the Assumption, she took off her crown, laid it before the Crucifix and, covering her face, lay prostrate on the ground. When her mother-in-law reprimanded her for this gesture, Elizabeth answered: \"How can I, a wretched creature, continue to wear a crown of earthly dignity, when I see my King Jesus Christ crowned with thorns?”\n<br>\n<br>\n\nShe behaved to her subjects in the same way that she behaved to God. Among the Sayings of the Four Maids we find this testimony: “She did not eat any food before ascertaining that it came from her husband\'s property or legitimate possessions. While she abstained from goods procured illegally, she also did her utmost to provide compensation to those who had suffered violence” (nn. 25 and 37).  She is the true example for all who have roles of leadership: the exercise of authority, at every level, must be lived as a service to justice and charity in the constant search for the common good.  Elizabeth diligently practiced works of mercy: she would give food and drink to those who knocked at her door, she procured clothing, paid debts, cared for the sick and buried the dead.  Coming down from her castle, she often visited the homes of the poor with her ladies-in-waiting, bringing them bread, meat, flour and other food.  She distributed the food personally and attentively checked the clothing and mattresses of the poor. This behaviour was reported to her husband, who not only was not displeased but answered her accusers, “So long as she does not sell the castle, I am happy with her!”.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe miracle of the loaves that were changed into roses fits into this context: while Elizabeth was on her way with her apron filled with bread for the poor, she met her husband who asked her what she was carrying. She opened her apron to show him and, instead of bread, it was full of magnificent roses. This symbol of charity often features in depictions of St Elizabeth.\n<br>\n<br>\nElizabeth\'s marriage was profoundly happy: she helped her husband to raise his human qualities to a supernatural level and he, in exchange, stood up for his wife\'s generosity to the poor and for her religious practices. Increasingly admired for his wife\'s great faith, Ludwig said to her, referring to her attention to the poor: “Dear Elizabeth, it is Christ whom you have cleansed, nourished and cared for”. A clear witness to how faith and love of God and neighbour strengthen family life and deepen ever more the matrimonial union.\nThe young couple found spiritual support in the Friars Minor who began to spread through Thuringia in 1222. Elizabeth chose from among them Friar Rodeger (Rüdiger) as her spiritual director. When he told her about the event of the conversion of Francis of Assisi, a rich young merchant, Elizabeth was even more enthusiastic in the journey of her Christian life.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrom that time she became even more determined to follow the poor and Crucified Christ, present in poor people. Even when her first son was born, followed by two other children, our Saint never neglected her charitable works. She also helped the Friars Minor to build a convent at Halberstadt, of which Friar Rodeger became superior. For this reason Elizabeth’s spiritual direction was taken on by Conrad of Marburg.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Elizabeth-of-Hungary-Two.jpg\" style=\"padding-left:20px;float:right;\">\nThe farewell to her husband was a hard trial, when, at the end of June in 1227 when Ludwig ivjoined the Crusade of the Emperor Frederick ii. He reminded his wife that this was traditional for the sovereigns of Thuringia. Elizabeth answered him: “Far be it from me to detain you. I have given my whole self to God and now I must also give you”.\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, fever decimated the troops and Ludwig himself fell ill and died in Otranto, before embarking, in September 1227. He was 27 years old. When Elizabeth learned the news, she was so sorrowful that she withdrew in solitude; but then, strengthened by prayer and comforted by the hope of seeing him again in Heaven, she began to attend to the affairs of the Kingdom.\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, another trial was lying in wait for Elizabeth. Her brother-in-law usurped the government of Thuringia, declaring himself to be the true heir of Ludwig and accusing Elizabeth of being a pious woman incapable of ruling. The young widow, with three children, was banished from the Castle of Wartburg and went in search of a place of refuge. Only two of her ladies remained close to her. They accompanied her and entrusted the three children to the care of Ludwig’s friends. Wandering through the villages, Elizabeth worked wherever she was welcomed, looked after the sick, spun thread and cooked.\n<br>\n<br>\nDuring this calvary which she bore with great faith, with patience and with dedication to God, a few relatives who had stayed faithful to her and viewed her brother-in-law\'s rule as illegal, restored her reputation. So it was that at the beginning of 1228, Elizabeth received sufficient income to withdraw to the family’s castle in Marburg, where her spiritual director, Fra Conrad, also lived.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt was he who reported the following event to Pope Gregory IX: “On Good Friday in 1228, having placed her hands on the altar in the chapel of her city, Eisenach, to which she had welcomed the Friars Minor, in the presence of several friars and relatives Elizabeth renounced her own will and all the vanities of the world. She also wanted to resign all her possessions, but I dissuaded her out of love for the poor. Shortly afterwards she built a hospital, gathered the sick and invalids and served at her own table the most wretched and deprived. When I reprimanded her for these things, Elizabeth answered that she received from the poor special grace and humility” (Epistula magistri Conradi, 14-17).\n<br>\n<br>\nWe can discern in this affirmation a certain mystical experience similar to that of St Francis: the Poverello of Assisi declared in his testament, in fact, that serving lepers, which he at first found repugnant, was transformed into sweetness of the soul and of the body (Testamentum, 1-3).\n<br>\n<br>\nElizabeth spent her last three years in the hospital she founded, serving the sick and keeping wake over the dying. She always tried to carry out the most humble services and repugnant tasks. She became what we might call a consecrated woman in the world (soror in saeculo) and, with other friends clothed in grey habits, formed a religious community. It is not by chance that she is the Patroness of the Third Order Regular of St Francis and of the Franciscan Secular Order.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn November 1231 she was stricken with a high fever. When the news of her illness spread, may people flocked to see her. After about 10 days, she asked for the doors to be closed so that she might be alone with God. In the night of 17 November, she fell asleep gently in the Lord. The testimonies of her holiness were so many and such that after only four years Pope Gregory IX canonized her and, that same year, the beautiful church built in her honour at Marburg was consecrated.\nDear brothers and sisters, in St Elizabeth we see how faith and friendship with Christ create a sense of justice, of the equality of all, of the rights of others and how they create love, charity. And from this charity is born hope too, the certainty that we are loved by Christ and that the love of Christ awaits us thereby rendering us capable of imitating Christ and of seeing Christ in others.\n<br>\n<br>\nSt Elizabeth invites us to rediscover Christ, to love him and to have faith; and thereby to find true justice and love, as well as the joy that one day we shall be immersed in divine love, in the joy of eternity with God.\n<br>\n<br>\nGiven by Pope Benedict XVI at the General Audience at St Peter’s Square, October 20, 2010\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Prayer</strong><br><br>\nFather,<br>\nYou helped Elizabeth of Hungary<br>\nto recognize and honor Christ<br>\nin the poor of this world.<br>\nLet her prayers help us to serve our brothers and sisters<br>\nin time of trouble and need.<br>\nWe ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,<br>\nwho lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>\none God, for ever and ever.

He lived for the welfare of his subjects and the glory of God. Louis was born in Poissy, France on 25 April 1215 to King Louis VIII, of the Capet line, and Blanche of Castile, daughter of King Alfonso of Castile and Eleanor of England. His father died when he was just eleven years old, and he was crowned -- at Rheims, like almost all French Kings -- on the First Sunday of Advent in 1226. His very strong and pious mother acted as his regent, suppressing various revolts to secure her son\'s place. She acted as regent even after he reached the age of majority, and guided his career with strong Christian advice, forming his character in holiness. Much of his virtue is attributed to his mother\'s care, for the Queen devoted herself to her children\'s education. Blanche\'s primary concern was to implant in him a deep regard and awe for everything related to religion. She would say to him, \"Never forget that sin is the only great evil in the world. No mother could love her son more than I love you. But I would rather see you lying dead at my feet than know that you had offended God by one mortal sin\" -- sentiments that he took to heart and would later pass on to his own son. (see below)\n<br>\n<br>\nOne of his first acts as king was to build the famous monastery of Royaumont, with funds left for the purpose by his father. Louis gave encouragement to the religious orders, installing the Carthusians in the palace of Vauvert in Paris, and assisting his mother in founding the convent of Maubuisson.\n<br>\n<br>\nLouis loved sermons, heard two Masses daily, and was surrounded, even while traveling, with priests chanting the hours. He forbade all forms of usury and protected vassals and tenants from cruel lords. In 1244, Louis announced his long-cherished intention of undertaking a crusade to the East. At first he was successful capturing the port city of Damietta, at the mouth of the Nile. Six months later in a battle with the Saracens at Mansourah his forces were defeated and he was captured. After length negotiations he and his fellow prisoners were released. Louis, with the remnant of his army, sailed to the Syrian coast and remained in that region until he return to France in 1254.\n<br>\n<br>\nHe was a great patron of learning, the arts, and architecture, and under his patronage, the famous college of theology, the Sorbonne was founded; abbeys built; and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Chapelle\">chapel of Ste. Chapelle</a>. This the beautiful chapel with the walls of stained glass that sits on the tiny Ile de la Cité right in the middle of Paris, in the Seine River (the same island where Notre Dame Cathedral is found). This chapel was built to house a part of the Crown of Thorns and a piece of the True Cross, which he purchased from Emperor Baldwin II in Constantinople, and it became St. Louis\'s personal royal chapel.\n<br>\n<br>\nLouis was very dedicated to the cause of peace, he not only arbitrated and made treaties with Henry VIII and James I of Aragon (The Peace of Paris), but did much to curb a lot of the petty, feudal warfare that caused so much harm. He was most famous for his charity, humility, and concern for the poor. He built many hospitals, among them the hospital known as \"Quinze-vingt\" (\"Fifteen-Twenty\") -- a hospital for the blind and whose name comes from the fact that it could care for 300 patients. He also received destitute people daily and saw that they were fed; in Lent and Advent he cared for all who came, often waiting on them in person. He had a passion for justice, and changed the \"King\'s court\" of his ancestors into a popular court, where he listened to any of his subjects who came with grievances and gave what seemed to them wise and impartial judgments. The feudal method of settling disputes by combat he tried to replace by peaceful arbitration or the judicial process of trial, with the presentation of testimony. In later times, whenever the French complained of oppression, their cry was for justice to be meted out impartially, as it had been in the reign of St. Louis.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 1270, he went off on another Crusade, this time in an attempt to convert the Emir of Tunis after being inspired by acting as godfather to a Jewish convert. Again, his Crusade failed, and again he became sick with dysentery. This time, though, he did not recover. He died on 25 August 1270. His last words were those of Christ: \"Into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\" He was canonized in 1297, 27 years after his death.\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/King-Louis-IX-Two.jpg\" style=\"padding-left:20px;float:right;\">\n<underline>King Saint Louis’s last Instructions to his Eldest Son, Philip III</underline>\n<br><br>\nTherefore, dear son, the first thing I advise is that you fix your whole heart upon God, and love Him with all your strength, for without this no one can be saved or be of any worth.\n<br><br>\nYou should, with all your strength, shun everything, which you believe to be displeasing to Him. And you ought especially to be resolved not to commit mortal sin, no matter what may happen and should permit all your limbs to be hewn off, and suffer every manner of torment, rather than fall knowingly into mortal sin.\n<br><br>\nIf our Lord send you any adversity, whether illness or other in good patience, and thank Him for it, thing, you should receive it in good patience and be thankful for it, for you ought to believe that He will cause everything to turn out for your good; and likewise you should think that you have well merited it, and more also, should He will it, because you have loved Him but little, and served Him but little, and have done many things contrary to His will.\n<br><br>\nIf our Lord send you any prosperity, either health of body or other thing you ought to thank Him humbly for it, and you ought to be careful that you are not the worse for it, either through pride or anything else, for it is a very great sin to fight against our Lord with His gifts.\n<br><br>\nI advise you that you accustom yourself to frequent confession, and that you choose always, as your confessors, men who are upright and sufficiently learned, and who can teach you what you should do and what you should avoid. You should so carry yourself that your confessors and other friends may dare confidently to reprove you and show you your faults.\n<br><br>\nIn conclusion, dear son, I give you all the blessings which a good and tender father can give to a son, and I pray our Lord Jesus Christ, by His mercy, by the prayers and merits of His blessed Mother, the Virgin Mary, and of angels and archangels and of all the saints, to guard and protect you from doing anything contrary to His will, and to give you grace to do it always, so that He may be honoured and served by you. And this may He do to me as to you, by His great bounty, so that after this mortal life we may be able to be together with Him in the eternal life, and see Him, love Him, and praise Him without end. Amen. And glory, honour, and praise be to Him who is one God with the Father and the Holy Spirit; without beginning and without end. Amen.\n<br><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[LLEN] The Life of Saint Louis IX of France','','publish','closed','closed','','the-life-of-saint-louis-ix-of-france','','','2020-10-12 13:07:58','2020-10-12 17:07:58','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=129',0,'page','',0),(130,1,'2020-09-28 13:34:49','2020-09-28 17:34:49','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> The Life of Saint Louis IX of France</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','The Life of Saint Louis IX of France','','inherit','closed','closed','','129-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 13:34:49','2020-09-28 17:34:49','',129,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/129-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(131,1,'2020-09-28 13:36:20','2020-09-28 17:36:20','','The Life of Saint Louis IX of France','','publish','closed','closed','','131','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=131',13,'nav_menu_item','',0),(132,1,'2020-09-28 13:36:20','2020-09-28 17:36:20','','Life of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary','','publish','closed','closed','','132','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=132',12,'nav_menu_item','',0),(133,1,'2020-09-28 13:36:20','2020-09-28 17:36:20','','The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi','','publish','closed','closed','','133','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=133',11,'nav_menu_item','',0),(134,1,'2020-09-28 13:36:20','2020-09-28 17:36:20','','The Life of Saint Francis of Assisi','','publish','closed','closed','','134','','','2020-09-28 20:03:04','2020-09-29 00:03:04','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?p=134',10,'nav_menu_item','',0),(136,1,'2020-09-28 13:36:48','2020-09-28 17:36:48','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Purpose of Formation</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Formation-Purpose-1.jpeg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\"/>When we look at the Secular Franciscan formation process, it is important to see it as a continuum, that is, each stage flowing into the next. Aspects that are essential in the first phase, <strong>ORIENTATION</strong> will still be essential in the second, <strong>INQUIRY</strong> the third, <strong>CANDIDACY</strong> and into the <a \n href=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/en/fpen-formation-process/\">Ongoing Formation</a> of <strong>PROFESSED MEMBERS</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Secular Franciscan Order, as all religious orders, has its <a href=\"https://secularfranciscansusa.org/the-rule-of-the-secular-franciscan-order/\">Rule</a> and General Constitution, the charism of the founders and the mission give to it by the Church. Our current Rule was approved by Pope Paul VI on June 24,1978.\n<br />\n<br />\nMembership in the Secular Franciscan Order is achieved through a journey, a time of formation. During the formative period candidates are invited to search out the will of God for them through study, prayer and reflection. The Fraternity provides an environment in which candidates experience more deeply the evangelical life, establish fraternal relationships and find ways for a more fruitful involvement in the life and the mission of the Church.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn Fraternities formation is \"carried out with frequent meetings for study and prayer and with concrete experiences of service and of apostolate\" (GC art. 40:1). During formation, the candidates are exposed to the key documents of the Franciscan life: Sacred Scriptures, the writings by and about St. Francis, the Rule and Constitution of the Order, and the national and regional statutes which have been approved for use in individual countries. “They are trained in love for the Church and the acceptance of her teaching. The laity practice living their secular commitment in the world in an evangelical way”. (GC art. 40: 2)\n<br />\n<br />\nThe last line of article 40:2 is particularly important; here the members of the Secular Franciscan Order are invited to see the world and their place in the world against the horizon of the Gospel as they move from \"Gospel to life and life to the Gospel\" as the Rule challenges them to do. In this sense, \"evangelical\" means a way of life, which is imbued and guided by the Gospel and personal example of Jesus.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe important element of continuous conversion in the Franciscan life is strengthened in article 44 of the Constitution. <a href=\"http://www.ofsnational.ca/ND_Objectives_EN.asp\">Formation</a> is not a stage of preparation from which a secular graduates. It is rather an invitation to a way of life in which one works toward spiritual growth and maturity.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"960\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/orexgZBj4As\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[PUEN] Purpose','','publish','closed','closed','','purpose','','','2020-10-12 13:27:49','2020-10-12 17:27:49','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=136',0,'page','',0),(137,1,'2020-09-28 13:36:48','2020-09-28 17:36:48','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Purpose of Formation</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Purpose','','inherit','closed','closed','','136-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 13:36:48','2020-09-28 17:36:48','',136,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/136-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(142,1,'2020-09-28 13:37:50','2020-09-28 17:37:50','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>National Formation Objectives</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/National-Formation-Objectives-One.png\" style=\"\">\n</td>\n<td>\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<h2>INITIAL FORMATION PROGRAM OF THE OFS OF CANADA</h2>\n<strong>General Objective</strong><br>\nTo respond to the call of Christ in the manner and spirit of St. Francis (Rule, Article 1)<br>\n<strong>Final Objective # 1</strong><br>\nTo discern the call<br>\n<strong>Final Objective # 2</strong><br>\nTo live the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ<br>\n<strong>Final Objective # 3</strong><br> \nTo acknowledge the importance of St Francis and St Clare in the life of the Church<br>\n<strong>Final Objective # 4</strong><br>\nTo incarnate the elements of Franciscan charism<br>\n</div>\n</td>\n<td>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/National-Formation-Objectives-Two.jpeg\" style=\"\">\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<h2>FOR THE NATIONAL FORMATION PROGRAM CONTENT AND DIRECTORY CLICK  NAFRA</h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"50%\">\n<strong>Initial Formation Program of the OFS of Canada</strong><br>\n<strong>PREFACE AND THANKS</strong><br><br>\nIn August 2009, we received from CIOFS Presidency, the French version of the FORMATION MANUAL for the formators of the Initial Formation.  At our first meeting, we, of the workgroup, quickly realized the need to adapt said Manual to our local needs.\n<br><br>\nAt first, each one of us went through all the sections of the MANUAL.  Then, we decided to point out the evident and less evident links to the Word of God and to each of the Articles of our Rules (Life Project) and our Constitutions.  We hereby present to you the fruits of our labour.\n<br><br>\nYou will realize that this Initial Formation Program spans over a minimum of 18 months without counting the 6 months required to attend the monthly meetings of the local Fraternity.  It is then up to the local Council to invite the candidate to start his initial formation. The latter will then freely decide to ask for this formation.\n<br><br>\nI now want to thank sincerely the members of the workgroup: Lise Bélec, Brother Henri Éthier, ofm, Fiore Francescocci, Gisèle Larose, Léona LeClair, and Françoise Malboeuf for their full support and their fraternal collaboration.  Thanks also to Madeleine Chaillé-St-Amant and her team; to Richard Casavant, to Richard Chamberland and his wife Micheline for having accepted to peruse over a section of the Manual.\n<br><br>\nI would like to thank also all those who, one way or another, have worked on this project.

In addition, concerns of the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace (CCODP); The Catholic Near East Welfare Association (CNEWA); and the Canadian Religious Conference (CRC) were considered. Since their discernment involved reading the signs of the times it is no surprise that there is much convergence of concern. \n<br>\n<br>\nAs a result, and because it is impossible to address every issue that arises, the primary priorities it is adopted the National Fraternity should focus on are:\n<ol>\n<li>Extreme poverty and the excluded</li>\n<li>The ethical use of resources: especially water, mining and fair trade</li>\n<li>Food: security and sovereignty</li>\n<li>Human Trafficking and Contemporary Forms of Slavery</li>\n<li>Care of Creation: particularly one or more of the following: Pollution; Climate Change; the Alberta Oil Sands and/or Hydraulic fracturing</li>\n<li>Peace, conflict resolution and active non-violence</li>\n<li>Treatment of Refugees, Internally Displaced Persons and Migrants</li>\n<li>Solidarity with, and support for, Christians in countries threatened by hostile cultures</li>\n<li>Current issues regarding Aboriginal Peoples in Canada</li>\n<li>Other topics at the discretion of the fraternities.</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong>THE PROCESS:  SEE, ACT, JUDGE</strong><br>\nThe process for dealing with these issues is to take information, together with Catholic Social Doctrine/Teaching and Franciscan Tradition and spirituality, as the basis for continuing formation which must then lead to action. “See, judge, act” (to which we add “evaluate and celebrate”), is the Catholic Action model favoured by many Catholic organisations including the <a href=\"www.ofm.org\">OFM JPIC Office.</a>  \n<br>\n<br>\nLocal Fraternities are asked to consider this plan and these issues at a General Meeting. The fraternities are asked to decide which issue(s) their Fraternity will address to the extent that they are able and to select (elect or appoint) a JPIC Councillor to promote and animate JPIC in their Fraternity.  Once the issues have been selected by a Fraternity, reference to the appendices of the JPIC Action Plan prepared by the relevant French or English Sector JPIC Sub-Commission will indicate resources for formation and action.\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<a href=\"http://www.franciscanvoicecanada.com/\"><strong>FRANCISCAN VOICE CANADA</strong></a><br>\nAdvocacy is a major tool of JPIC action.

Our family is where God has placed us! How can we reach our children and grand children within our own families? By following Jesus and His words, by following our Rule as a Secular Franciscan and by living the Gospel, we are reaching out to our family\n<br />\n<br />\nA Secular Franciscan is called to a deeper service and love of others. We are called to help in the mission of “rebuilding” the Church. We are called to simplicity and joy. The Family is the little church – the home church - It stands to reason that building up families will help build up the Church.\n<br />\n<br />\nOur Franciscan Family, is a wonderful family to share!! We can begin by being inclusive whenever possible, with family events, playing games, going fishing, telling stories and sharing faith and meals, whenever possible, with our children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren and all the Lord may bring!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jesus shows us how to prioritize children as part of our mission of Love:</strong>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>&quot;suffer the children to come to me and do not stop them&quot;</li>\n<li>And &quot;unless you become as a child you cannot enter the kingdom!&quot;</li>\n<li>And, &quot;better that a rock be tied around your neck and you be tossed into the sea, than what my Father will do to anyone who harms one of His little ones.&quot;</li>\n<li>And then again let us hear Jesus: when one of the few things recorded that He spoke on the way to His death and in the midst of His suffering He found the strength to say to us, &quot;Weep not for me but for yourselves and your children&quot;,</li>\n<br />\n<br />\nDo we weep for our children and our selves sometimes? Many families need our tears, prayers and help, today more than ever!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>St. Francis defined Evangelization</strong><br />\nFrancis said, “to evangelize a person, understand, is to say to him (her), “You also are loved by the Lord.” And not only to say it to him (her) but to truly think it, And not only to think it, but to behave with this person in such a manner that he(she) feels and discovers that there is in him (her) something saved, something greater and nobler than he(she) had thought! And so he (she) awakens to a new awareness of himself. That is what it means to announce the Good News.” (editor added in brackets)\n<br />\n<br />\nThis evangelization, taught by St. Francis is Beautiful and at the same time it is “radical.” Can we live this Evangelization with Children and Youth? Yes we can! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by telling stories of faith, parables, personal witness and life experiences, as the Holy Spirit leads us in our family gatherings! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by knowing the scriptures the Lord has said and what St. Francis has said. And we can reinforce these thoughts by praying for and with, our children and youth , sharing the prayers of the Church like the Rosary, experiencing Adoration and prayers from the heart.<br />\n<iframe width=\"342\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydytcpSEOwQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\nYes we can evangelize. We can build them up by being welcoming to our children and youth at family gatherings and maybe even in our fraternal gatherings offering a safe place to gather, creating some special times for celebrating and having fun! Giving our children and youth little roles of responsibility and allow them to help if they want to, gives an opportunity for them to respond to the good! Without pressure and this will help them feel valued! The Holy Spirit will guide us in living the Gospel with all we meet like St. Francis and St. Clare especially with the little souls entrusted to us in our families! You are not by chance related to that little child!\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>“special” he is... and so are all our children especially to the Lord!</li>\n<li>How about building a “mail box” for God and writing or drawing pictures to send to Him?</li>\n</lu>\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<strong>Practical Ideas:</strong><br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>In little things, remember, “bloom” where you are planted and in all things big or little things. What is happening in my parish with youth that I can help with? Is there something at the school I could do? Is there something at home?\nWhat am I or my Fraternity doing that could include family? Could we have a family potluck?</li>\n<li>Would my children, grand children, nieces, nephews, like it if I showed the cartoon of St. Francis or shared a colouring book?\nWhat craft or skill can I share with my children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins?</li>\n<li>How can I support my Parish Youth Group? Could I share “stories and prayers and activities” that show my Franciscan Charism?\nCan I be more “present” “love more” “listen better” Laugh longer with my family?</li>\n<li>Perhaps a little cleaning project, somewhere? Kids love to be active and to do things that are appreciated by others! My two year old grandson loves to hold my rosary and bless himself! He loves games and he likes helping his dad carry wood and helping “granny” wash dishes. When he helps with the windows, it makes more work for mommy and granny BUT he feels so good and happy it is worth it!! He feels “special” he is... and so are all our children especially to the Lord!</li>\n<li>How about building a “mail box” for God and writing or drawing pictures to send to Him?</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What comes to your mind?</strong><br />\nWe are already witnessing to children! We are the living book they see and hear! Do NOT be afraid but only listen to your heart and the Holy Spirit. The Lord will guide you in this most beautiful and precious part of our mission and family. There is no act of kindness that is too small! There is NO person too small! Who comes to mind right now? Who will be the first child or youth that God will place before me to share in a deeper way? Remember it is in the little things done in love that children grow into holy people! They say a child is formed by the age of 7 years. Remember that in the passing of 7 years, a 3 year old is now 10 years old. And then another 7 years and a 10 year old becomes 17. These are vital years of formation, because before you know it that 17 year old is an adult! Years go fast!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Important Note</strong><br />\nWhen working with Youth in your Parish be sure to follow the Guidelines in place by your local Parish or Diocese. Most ministry and volunteer work, that is with those most vulnerable, i.e. the young and the old, require a CPIC (Police Criminal Record Check ) When the work is volunteer, there is usually no costs related to this.<br /><br />\n<iframe width=\"330\" height=\"215\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwPwLTs-ze4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong> \nYOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS\nVISIT OUR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS PAGE</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Brochure & Handouts, \nPrayer Program and \nResources Page \n</strong><br /><br />\nRESOURCES\n<br>\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Resource-Page.pdf\">Tools for Evangelizing Youth and Young Adults</a><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/youfra_brochure.pdf\">Youfra Brochure</a><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A-Prayer-for-Youth.pdf\">An OFS Prayer for Youth</a><br/>\n<br>\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prayer-Intentions-for-OFS-and-Youfra-2020.pdf\">Monthly Prayer Intentions 2020 for OFS and Youfra</a><br/><br>\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Resources.pdf\">Additional Resources</a><br /><br />\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[FYEN] Franciscan Youth Program','','publish','closed','closed','','franciscan-youth-program','','','2020-10-19 10:54:55','2020-10-19 14:54:55','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=161',0,'page','',0),(162,1,'2020-09-28 13:42:43','2020-09-28 17:42:43','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Placeholder</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Franciscan Youth Program','','inherit','closed','closed','','161-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 13:42:43','2020-09-28 17:42:43','',161,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/161-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(164,1,'2020-09-28 13:43:21','2020-09-28 17:43:21','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Young Adults YOUFRA</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<strong>“Gospel living as modeled by St. Francis of Assisi”  Is God Calling You to Journey with St. Francis?</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\nYOUFRA\nYouFra is a journey of Franciscan Spirituality for young people attracted by the life of St Francis of Assisi and who seek to deepen their life with God, their understanding of self, of others and the exceptional beauty of creation.

We make haste to discover new treasures on our way. Is it not in Assisi where we find St Francis\' joy and love? Listen to the whistling of the air through the trees, these peaceful sounds speak, of heaven above.\nOur feet pound the pavement, muscles burn from contracting; we are climbing the soft stone streets of this city. Hearts beating warmly from so many scenes attracting. Gazing downward from this mountain green with vegetation,\nfarmers plow their fields as the earth is waiting to be worked in. All the shades of green arranged in God\'s good presentation. Mountains line the horizon with a bluish stare. Beyond these heights is God\'s power, in awe our souls become aware. The air covers the mountains and lines them with mist. The sky is pastel blue and broad, light radiates through the clouds, in a way one can\'t resist. O Assisi, precious home of my saint, your creation moves me softly, with pictures I could never paint. I praise you Lord God, for this beautiful creation!\nI\'m thankful to be able to see St Francis\' inspiration.\n<br />\n<img src=\"\" />\n<strong>Second Reflection: Letter from Caitlynn Rainey</strong>\n <br />\n <br />\nDear friends,\nOur trip to Assisi was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. Not only did we get to learn a lot about the life of St. Francis, but we had the chance to make life long friendships with people from around the world.\n <br />\n <br />\nExperiencing the Italian culture was full of surprises as we ate and drank like pure Italians, and admired the beautiful surroundings wherever we traveled to. Our journey to Italy allowed me to find peace within myself, discover who I really am, and become closer to God.  Everyday we had the chance to think about and pray for our intentions, and having the feeling that we were so closely connected to God was just incredible. Being there for one week made it possible to socialize and take part in social activities with other countries, as we built trusting friendships with them.\n <br />\n <br />\nIf I had to choose my most favorite part about the trip, I don\'t think I could because everyday was filled with new and exciting experiences that enlightened my life.\n <br />\n <br />\nSincerely, <br />\nCaitlynn Rainey  <br />\nBracebridge, Ontario. <br />\n<br />\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\"></td>\n<td width=\"33%\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[YAEN] Young Adults YOUFRA','','publish','closed','closed','','young-adults-youfra','','','2020-10-12 19:48:56','2020-10-12 23:48:56','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/?page_id=164',0,'page','',0),(165,1,'2020-09-28 13:43:21','2020-09-28 17:43:21','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Placeholder Text</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Young Adults YOUFRA','','inherit','closed','closed','','164-revision-v1','','','2020-09-28 13:43:21','2020-09-28 17:43:21','',164,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/28/164-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(167,1,'2020-09-28 13:43:51','2020-09-28 17:43:51','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>The News</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\nLetter of the  OFM Minister General Fr.

We might say he goes to meet enemy number one. Francis goes to live out the command of Jesus that we are to love our enemies, to pray for those who persecute us. In Francis own writing he recalls that Jesus called his betrayer, Judas – a friend. And that Jesus prayed for those who put him to death, asking the Father to forgive them. If Jesus did this then so must he. So Francis goes to Egypt to meet his enemy, to make his enemy his friend. Amazingly he does just that.\n<br /><br />\nFrancis went to Egypt where the forces of Christendom faced the forces of the Muslems at the port city of Damiatta. After asking the Christian commander to stop the fighting, which the commander refused to do, Francis and a companiom, Brother Illuminatus, set out, unarmed to see the Sultan of Egypt, Malik-al-Kamil. The men of the Sultan’s army captured Francis and his companion and dragged them, beaten and exhausted, before the Sultan.\n<br /><br />\nSt. Bonaventure, in his Major Life of St. Francis, described the event, “The Sultan asked them by whom and why and in what capacity they had been sent, and how they got there; but Francis replied that they had been sent by God, not by men, to show him and his subjects the way of salvation and proclaim the truth of the Gospel message. When the sultan saw his enthusiasm and courage, he listened to him willingly and pressed him to stay with him.”\n<br /><br />\nIn the encounter between them, both Francis and the Sultan were changed. When Francis finally left to return to Italy, the Sultan showered him with many gifts and treasures. Because he had no interest in worldly wealth, Francis refused them all, except one special gift: an ivory horn used by the muezzin to call the faithful to prayer. On his return, Francis used it to call people for prayer or for preaching.</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":392,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/The-Sultan-Two.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392\"/><figcaption>The Sultan</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[TSEN] The Sultan','','inherit','closed','closed','','107-revision-v1','','','2020-09-29 15:16:20','2020-09-29 19:16:20','',107,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/29/107-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(394,1,'2020-09-29 15:29:08','2020-09-29 19:29:08','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>A Dwelling Place</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\">\nAn important aspect of Franciscan Spirituality is to make room for God in our lives.

St Francis is responsible for the popularity of Christmas Midnight Mass and Nativities scenes in Churches and homes. St Francis of Assisi was so taken by the mystery of the Incarnation that he wanted to present it anew in a living Nativity scene, He is perhaps the first to have a live nativity scene with animals and people playing the part of Mary, Joseph, the shepherds and wise men. This happened near the town of Greccio three years before his death. St. Bonaventure in his Life of St. Francis of Assisi tells the story the best:\n<br />\n<br />\n“He wanted to commemorate the nativity of the Infant Jesus with great devotion, he prepared a manger, and brought hay, and an ox and an ass to the place appointed. The brethren were summoned, the people ran together, the forest resounded with their voices, and that venerable night was made glorious by many and brilliant lights and sonorous psalms of praise. The man of God [St. Francis] stood before the manger, full of devotion and piety, bathed in tears and radiant with joy; the Holy Gospel was chanted by Francis. Then he preached to the people about the nativity of the poor and humble King; and being unable to utter His name for the tenderness of His love, He called Him the Babe of Bethlehem. A certain valiant soldier, Master John of Greccio, affirmed that he beheld an Infant marvellously beautiful, sleeping in the manger, whom the blessed Father Francis embraced with both his arms, as if he would awake Him from sleep. This vision of the devout soldier is credible”.</p>\n<p>a humble stable. Even today nativities scenes and pageants still touch the hearts of all who see them\nPicture\nThe Paschal Mystery.  We adore You,  O Christ and we praise you, because by your cross You have redeemed the world.” Most of us will recognize this pray as part of the Stations of the Cross. It actual is a shorten form of a prayer by St. Francis. We find it in his Testament. “The Lord gave me such faith in churches that I would simply pray and speak in this way: we adore You, Lord Jesus Christ, in all Your Churches throughout the world, and we bless You, for through Your holy Cross You have redeemed the world.”  When Francis meditated on the Cross: \"His whole soul seemed to melt away; and so deeply was the memory of Christ\'s Passion impressed on his heart, that it pierced even to the marrow of his bones. From that hour, whenever he thought of the Passion of Christ he could scarcely restrain his tears and sighs.\"\n\nCelano relates, \"From that hour he was pierced with compassion for the Crucified Saviour, so that for the rest of his life he bore in his heart the holy wounds, which later were also impressed upon his body. The sufferings of Christ were ever before his eyes, and filled them with ever-flowing tears.\"<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Three-Key-Mysteries-Two.jpeg\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\"></p>\n<p>Two years before his death after a retreat of many weeks meditating on the love of Christ in the Passion Francis was mark with the sacred wounds of Christ the stigmata. Christ appeared to him as a six wing saraph. Francis through his daily meditations on the cross was able to live out the words of St. Paul “ May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal 6,14). Franciscan spirituality encourages us to do the same.</p><br />\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Three-Key-Mysteries-Three.jpeg\" style=\"float:left; padding-right:20px;\" />Eucharist is amazing how often Francis mentioned the Eucharist in his letters. Whether he was writing to Rulers, the Friars or the brothers and sisters of penance he encouraged all to receive the Eucharist. In the Rule of 1221 Francis tells the friars: “let them receive the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ with great humility and veneration, calling to mind what the Lord Himself says: ‘He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has everlasting life and do this in memory of me.” \n<br />\n<br />\nNear the end of his life, when he was unable to attend the General Chapter he sent these words to the friars. “I conjure you all, brothers, kissing your feet and with the charity of which I am capable, to show all reverence and honour possible to the most holy body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the things that are in heaven and the things that are on earth are pacified and reconciled to almighty God”. St Francis in his own time encouraged people to have a greater devotion and understanding of the Eucharist in these short few words.  \"Every fiber of the heart of Francis was aglow with love for the sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ.  He considered it an unpardonable negligence not to attend Mass each day whenever possible.  If he could not make it to Mass due to illness he would have the Gospel of the day read to him.  If I can not be present at Mass, I adore the Body of Christ in adoration and with the eyes of the soul\". </p>\n<p>I think each of us can understand the humility of God both in the Incarnation in the Passion. “And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of death – even death on the cross” (Phil 2:8). What is most interesting is that Francis adds the Eucharist to his mediations on the humility of God. Francis was profoundly struck by the humility of Jesus who, for love of humanity, deigned to be with us under the appearance of bread and wine. He wrote in the 1st Admonition: “Behold, each day He humbles Himself as when he came from the royal throne into the Virgin’s womb; each day He Himself comes to us, appearing humbly; each day He comes down from the bosom of the Father upon the altar in the hands of a priest. As He revealed Himself to the holy apostles in true flesh, so He reveals Himself to us now in sacred bread. And as they saw only His flesh by an insight of their flesh, yet believed that He was God as they contemplated Him with their spiritual eyes, let us, as we see bread and wine with our bodily eyes, see and firmly believe that they are His most holy Body and Blood living and true.\n<br />\n<br />\n\nFor Francis the Eucharist is the continuation in time of the mystery of Christ, begun at the Incarnation, reaching climax at the Paschal Mystery and continuing in the Eucharist – the crib, the cross, and the Eucharist. The Eucharist is the poverty of Christ continued in time. In his Letter to a Chapter, we see that the Eucharist symbolized for Francis the complete self-giving of Christ.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\"Let the whole of mankind tremble, the whole world shake and the heavens exult when Christ, the Son of the living God, is [present] on the altar in the hands of a priest. O admirable heights and sublime lowliness! O sublime humility! O humble sublimity! That the Lord of the universe, God and the Son of God, so humbles Himself that for our salvation He hides Himself under the little form of Bread! Look, brothers, at the humility of God and pour out your heart before Him! Humble yourselves, as well, that you may be exalted by Him. Therefore hold back nothing of yourselves for yourselves so that He who gives Himself totally to you may receive you totally\".\n<br />\n<br />\nFrancis wanted to die at the Portiuncula, the little church of St Mary of the Angel, the little portion of heaven. He wanted to give up the breath of life where he had first experienced the breath of Grace. As he lay dying he asked that the Gospel of John chapter 13 be read. We hear this Gospel every Holy Thursday. It is about Jesus washing the feet of his disciples.\n<br />\n<br />\nDo you know what I have done to you? You call me Teacher and Lord—and you are right, for that is what I am. So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. For I have set you an example that you also should do as I have done to you”. (John 13:12-15)\n<br />\n<br />\nAs he was dying he told the friars who were present: “I have done my part, may Christ teach you to do yours”.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">\n“The Exhortation of our Blessed Father Francis”\n<br />\n<br />\nO most beloved Friars and Sons forever blessed,\nhear me; hear the voice of your father.\nGreat things we have promised;\nGreater have been promised us.\nLet us observe the former:\nLet us aspire to the latter.\nPleasure is slight; glory, infinite.\nMany are called; few are chosen; retribution for all.\nBrethren, while we have time, let us do good.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[TKEN] Three Key Mysteries','','inherit','closed','closed','','113-revision-v1','','','2020-09-29 15:49:34','2020-09-29 19:49:34','',113,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/29/113-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(402,1,'2020-09-29 15:51:28','2020-09-29 19:51:28','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Three Key Mysteries</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Three-Key-Mysteries-One.jpeg\" style=\"float:left; padding-right:20px;\" />Lets first look at the Incarnation.

It was a time of great social, economic, political and religious change. It was a time of the re-emergence of the Merchant class, the Guilds, and a whole new economic system. It was a world of the Lords and the serfs; of haves and have-nots; of the strong and the weak.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike any young man Francis wanted to do something important in his life. His father wanted him to be a cloth merchant like himself and perhaps take over the business one day. Francis dreamed of being a Knight. His father wasn’t apposed to this for if Francis became a knight then the family would move up in social standing. But God had a different plan, a different calling for him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a battle between the neighbour towns of Perugia and Assisi the combatants from Assisi lost. Francis and others were captured and held for ransom. It was a year before his Father finally agreed on a ransom price and paid for his release. This imprisonment change Francis’ life. During his time in prison he began to pray for guidance from God. He continued this after his release. Often he would pray in the small churches in and around Assisi. He left his followers one of his prayers for guidance. It is referred to as the prayer before the crucifix:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:ccenter\">Most High, glorious God,<br/>\nenlighten the darkness of my heart.<br/>\nand give me true faith, certain hope,<br/>\nand perfect charity,... sense and knowledge, Lord,<br/>\nthat I may carry out Your holy and true command.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>After a while others joined him. Bernard of Quintavalle, an aristocrat from the town, was the first to join Francis, and then Peter of Cattane, a well-known canon of the cathedral. So they went to the local church to seek the guidance of the Lord. They prayed and then opened the Book of the Gospels three times. This is what they found:</p>\n<p><ul>\n<li><underline>Matthew 19: 16, 21</underline> Then a young man came and asked, ‘Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life? …If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money* to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.</li>\n<li><underline>Matthew 16: 24</underline> If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</li>\n<li><underline>Luke 14: 26</underline> Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\" />\n</p>\n<p>This shall be our rule of life,\" exclaimed Francis, and led his companions to the public square, where they gave away all their belongings to the poor.\n<p>When Francis had about 12 followers he wrote a rule in a few words and went to Rome to have his way of life approved by the Pope. In his Testament St Francis tells us “And after the Lord gave me brothers, no one showed me what I should do, but the Most High Himself revealed to me that I should live according to the form of the Holy Gospel. And I had this written down simply and in a few words and the Lord Pope confirmed it for me. And those who came to receive life gave to the poor everything which they were capable of possessing and they were content with one tunic, patched inside and out, with a cord and short trousers. And we had no desire for anything more”.</p>\nEven today those who wish to join the Friars are asked to sell all they have, give to the poor and come follow Christ.\n<br />\n<br />\nThere is a story that the Pope did not want to approve this way of life for Francis.

It was a time of great social, economic, political and religious change. It was a time of the re-emergence of the Merchant class, the Guilds, and a whole new economic system. It was a world of the Lords and the serfs; of haves and have-nots; of the strong and the weak.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLike any young man Francis wanted to do something important in his life. His father wanted him to be a cloth merchant like himself and perhaps take over the business one day. Francis dreamed of being a Knight. His father wasn’t apposed to this for if Francis became a knight then the family would move up in social standing. But God had a different plan, a different calling for him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn a battle between the neighbour towns of Perugia and Assisi the combatants from Assisi lost.

During his time in prison he began to pray for guidance from God. He continued this after his release. Often he would pray in the small churches in and around Assisi. He left his followers one of his prayers for guidance. It is referred to as the prayer before the crucifix:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:ccenter\">Most High, glorious God,<br/>\nenlighten the darkness of my heart.<br/>\nand give me true faith, certain hope,<br/>\nand perfect charity,... sense and knowledge, Lord,<br/>\nthat I may carry out Your holy and true command.<br/>\n</p>\n<p>After a while others joined him. Bernard of Quintavalle, an aristocrat from the town, was the first to join Francis, and then Peter of Cattane, a well-known canon of the cathedral. So they went to the local church to seek the guidance of the Lord. They prayed and then opened the Book of the Gospels three times. This is what they found:</p>\n<p><ul>\n<li><underline>Matthew 19: 16, 21</underline> Then a young man came and asked, ‘Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life? …If you wish to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give the money* to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.</li>\n<li><underline>Matthew 16: 24</underline> If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</li>\n<li><underline>Luke 14: 26</underline> Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Francis-Two.jpg\" style=\"float:right;padding-left:20px;\" />\n</p>\n<p>This shall be our rule of life,\" exclaimed Francis, and led his companions to the public square, where they gave away all their belongings to the poor.\n<p>When Francis had about 12 followers he wrote a rule in a few words and went to Rome to have his way of life approved by the Pope. In his Testament St Francis tells us “And after the Lord gave me brothers, no one showed me what I should do, but the Most High Himself revealed to me that I should live according to the form of the Holy Gospel. And I had this written down simply and in a few words and the Lord Pope confirmed it for me. And those who came to receive life gave to the poor everything which they were capable of possessing and they were content with one tunic, patched inside and out, with a cord and short trousers.

She was born of nobility, the oldest child of Ortulana and Favarone di Offreduccio.  At the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century, Italy was a cauldron of political and military strife. Society was divided into two groups: the maiores and minores. The maiores were the nobility. The minores were former serfs, who had become merchants, craftsmen and field workers. These two groups were continually fighting for power among themselves.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn her early youth, Clare was exiled to Perugia. While the men in the family were off fighting their wars, the women chose to live as penitents. Ortulana, along with her daughters, as well as other women among Clare\'s family and friends, were fasting, praying, bringing food to the poor and visiting prisoners.  This time of suffering and exile became a time of spiritual formation. Many of the women living with Clare in Perugia, including her mother and sisters, later became some of Clare\'s first followers in San Damiano.\n</p>\n<p>In 1205, Clare\'s family returned to Assisi. Francis had already begun his conversion. He had publicly renounced his father and started rebuilding San Damiano. In 1208, he began preaching. Clare\'s cousin Rufino became one of his early followers.  Clare\'s household had to have experienced the stir that Francis was causing. An eyewitness, cited in the Acts of the Process of Canonization [of Clare], said that, during this time, Clare went to hear Francis preach, gave him some money to rebuild churches and to feed the poor, and arranged to talk to him in private.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare and Francis were both experiencing God breaking into their lives, changing them and calling them to give themselves over to God. Both were facing unknowns and both were probably frightened and unsure of themselves. It must have been a comforting grace to meet a kindred spirit and to encounter another human being who was experiencing the same call and facing the same doubts. Clare\'s sister Beatrice tells us (in the document of the canonization process) that Francis first initiated the visit with Clare. Some speculation suggests that women were asking to join his movement and Francis needed a strong woman to lead the others.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare\'s reputation for holiness was well known in Assisi. She would be the perfect leader. Who went to whom first is unimportant. The important reality was that God had a plan and that Francis and Clare were open to being led.  Francis and the brothers received Clare on Palm Sunday night at the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels (the Portiuncula) in the year 1212. Shortly after this, she was taken to San Paolo, a Benedictine monastery in Bastia.  The men in Clare\'s family were not happy with her following Francis. Their power and wealth were diminishing with the changes in society. Clare was beautiful and they had hoped that her marriage would bring prestige and continued wealth into the family. They followed her to San Paolo with every intention of bringing her home.  Clare instead held on to the altar and claimed sanctuary. She had made her choice. She would never turn back.  Clare\'s sister Catherine, soon to be called Agnes, joined Clare. The two lived for a while with a group of Beguines (13th-century women under vows) in Sant\'Angelo in Panzo until Francis brought them to the church of San Damiano. There, the Lord gave them sisters and their community grew quickly.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare\'s community was to be vastly different from the monastic communities of her time. The sisters were to live poorly without large land holdings. Like Francis, their Rule would be to embrace the gospel form of life. They would all be of equal rank, and all decisions affecting their life would be made by all of them.  They would have an abbess, but she would consider herself \"the servant of the sisters\" and she would lead more by her example of virtue than by instruction or admonition.  Clare was the perfect follower of Francis. She understood his message and would spend her entire life making it a lived reality. Her life and the lives of the early sisters, however, were not easy ones.\n<br />\n<br />\nFrancis died young. Clare outlived him by 27 years. She remained firm and kept the ideal alive, despite Francis\' absence and the dissension among his brothers. The Church would see the poverty of her life as too difficult. She negotiated with popes and worked to get her Rule approved until the day before she died—August 10, 1253.\nWithin the context of the medieval world of the 13th century, Clare lived and struggled with many of the issues that are present in our day. She was a woman of strength and courage, of wisdom and insight, of patience and with an innate gift of leadership. Looking closely at her, we can learn much about the response to life that enables us to be free in a world where oppression abounds. As a medieval woman born into a rich and powerful family, her role in life was defined for her when she was still a child by the men who ruled the clan. She would be married to a man of their choosing, someone whose assets and social standing would make the clan even more powerful. Her wishes were considered irrelevant, until the day she sold her inheritance, instantly making her worthless in the marriage market.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare\'s society was rigidly stratified. She broke down those class structures by insisting that everyone work with their hands and that everyone was equal in every way. Without hesitation, she swept away all the artificial class distinctions that society had created and which led to wars and violence. Clare has much to teach us about living together on our planet earth as sisters and brothers, all children of the one God.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare understood the links between money and power. Economic freedom equals social freedom which in this context paves the way for spiritual freedom. Clare\'s life of absolute poverty cuts through all the enticements of our consumerist culture. Clare exhorted her sisters who served outside the monastery to: Praise God for every green and flowering plant that you see; for every human person and for every creature. The environmental crisis is the result of a lack of care and reverence for the good things that God has given us for our use and our happiness. In beholding a flower, a sunset, the vast ocean, the varieties of animals, the sun, moon, stars, human beings so often fail to see, as Clare did, the reflection of a loving Creator of all these wonders.\n<br />\n<br />\nHer wisdom and holiness were recognized far and wide, and Popes and prelates came to her to recommend themselves to her prayer. In our contemporary world, women all over the globe are experiencing their worth and dignity in a new way and are struggling to resist the forces of oppression and domination which perpetuate the evil of unhealthy dependence. In this struggle Clare has much to teach all of us.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare is as relevant today as she was in the thirteenth century. Perhaps even more so because like all holy people, she was a prophet whose message is timeless.\n</p>\n<img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Clair-Two.jpg\" style=\"align:center;\" />\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[FCEN] The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi','','inherit','closed','closed','','124-revision-v1','','','2020-09-29 17:24:29','2020-09-29 21:24:29','',124,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/29/124-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(413,1,'2020-09-29 17:28:18','2020-09-29 21:28:18','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Clair.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\" />Clare was born in 1193 in Assisi, a small town in the scenic Umbrian Valley of Italy.

An eyewitness, cited in the Acts of the Process of Canonization [of Clare], said that, during this time, Clare went to hear Francis preach, gave him some money to rebuild churches and to feed the poor, and arranged to talk to him in private.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare and Francis were both experiencing God breaking into their lives, changing them and calling them to give themselves over to God. Both were facing unknowns and both were probably frightened and unsure of themselves. It must have been a comforting grace to meet a kindred spirit and to encounter another human being who was experiencing the same call and facing the same doubts. Clare\'s sister Beatrice tells us (in the document of the canonization process) that Francis first initiated the visit with Clare. Some speculation suggests that women were asking to join his movement and Francis needed a strong woman to lead the others.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare\'s reputation for holiness was well known in Assisi. She would be the perfect leader. Who went to whom first is unimportant. The important reality was that God had a plan and that Francis and Clare were open to being led.  Francis and the brothers received Clare on Palm Sunday night at the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels (the Portiuncula) in the year 1212. Shortly after this, she was taken to San Paolo, a Benedictine monastery in Bastia.  The men in Clare\'s family were not happy with her following Francis. Their power and wealth were diminishing with the changes in society. Clare was beautiful and they had hoped that her marriage would bring prestige and continued wealth into the family. They followed her to San Paolo with every intention of bringing her home.  Clare instead held on to the altar and claimed sanctuary. She had made her choice. She would never turn back.  Clare\'s sister Catherine, soon to be called Agnes, joined Clare. The two lived for a while with a group of Beguines (13th-century women under vows) in Sant\'Angelo in Panzo until Francis brought them to the church of San Damiano. There, the Lord gave them sisters and their community grew quickly.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare\'s community was to be vastly different from the monastic communities of her time. The sisters were to live poorly without large land holdings. Like Francis, their Rule would be to embrace the gospel form of life. They would all be of equal rank, and all decisions affecting their life would be made by all of them.  They would have an abbess, but she would consider herself \"the servant of the sisters\" and she would lead more by her example of virtue than by instruction or admonition.  Clare was the perfect follower of Francis. She understood his message and would spend her entire life making it a lived reality. Her life and the lives of the early sisters, however, were not easy ones.\n<br />\n<br />\nFrancis died young. Clare outlived him by 27 years. She remained firm and kept the ideal alive, despite Francis\' absence and the dissension among his brothers. The Church would see the poverty of her life as too difficult. She negotiated with popes and worked to get her Rule approved until the day before she died—August 10, 1253.\nWithin the context of the medieval world of the 13th century, Clare lived and struggled with many of the issues that are present in our day. She was a woman of strength and courage, of wisdom and insight, of patience and with an innate gift of leadership. Looking closely at her, we can learn much about the response to life that enables us to be free in a world where oppression abounds. As a medieval woman born into a rich and powerful family, her role in life was defined for her when she was still a child by the men who ruled the clan. She would be married to a man of their choosing, someone whose assets and social standing would make the clan even more powerful. Her wishes were considered irrelevant, until the day she sold her inheritance, instantly making her worthless in the marriage market.\n<br />\n<br />\nClare\'s society was rigidly stratified. She broke down those class structures by insisting that everyone work with their hands and that everyone was equal in every way.

Economic freedom equals social freedom which in this context paves the way for spiritual freedom. Clare\'s life of absolute poverty cuts through all the enticements of our consumerist culture. Clare exhorted her sisters who served outside the monastery to: Praise God for every green and flowering plant that you see; for every human person and for every creature. The environmental crisis is the result of a lack of care and reverence for the good things that God has given us for our use and our happiness.

She was born of nobility, the oldest child of Ortulana and Favarone di Offreduccio.  At the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century, Italy was a cauldron of political and military strife. Society was divided into two groups: the maiores and minores. The maiores were the nobility. The minores were former serfs, who had become merchants, craftsmen and field workers. These two groups were continually fighting for power among themselves.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn her early youth, Clare was exiled to Perugia. While the men in the family were off fighting their wars, the women chose to live as penitents. Ortulana, along with her daughters, as well as other women among Clare\'s family and friends, were fasting, praying, bringing food to the poor and visiting prisoners.  This time of suffering and exile became a time of spiritual formation. Many of the women living with Clare in Perugia, including her mother and sisters, later became some of Clare\'s first followers in San Damiano.\n</p>\n<p>In 1205, Clare\'s family returned to Assisi.

Her father was Andrew II, the rich and powerful King of Hungary. To reinforce political ties he had married the German Countess Gertrude of Andechs-Meran, sister of St Hedwig who was wife to the Duke of Silesia. Elizabeth, together with her sister and three brothers, spent only the first four years of her childhood at the Hungarian court. She liked playing, music and dancing; she recited her prayers faithfully and already showed special attention to the poor, whom she helped with a kind word or an affectionate gesture.\n<br />\n<br />\nHer happy childhood was suddenly interrupted when some knights arrived from distant Thuringia to escort her to her new residence in Central Germany. In fact, complying with the customs of that time, Elizabeth\'s father had arranged for her to become a Princess of Thuringia. The Landgrave or Count of this region was one of the richest and most influential sovereigns in Europe at the beginning of the 13th century and his castle was a centre of magnificence and culture.\n<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the festivities and apparent glory concealed the ambition of feudal princes who were frequently warring with each other and in conflict with the royal and imperial authorities. In this context the Landgrave Hermann very willingly accepted the betrothal of his son Ludwig to the Hungarian Princess. Elizabeth left her homeland with a rich dowry and a large entourage, including her personal ladies-in-waiting, two of whom were to remain faithful friends to the very end. It is they who left us the precious information on the childhood and life of the Saint.\n<br />\n<br />\nThey reached Eisenach after a long journey and made the ascent to the Fortress of Wartburg, the strong castle towering over the city. It was here that the betrothal of Ludwig and Elizabeth was celebrated. In the ensuing years, while Ludwig learned the knightly profession, Elizabeth and her companions studied German, French, Latin, music, literature and embroidery. Despite the fact that political reasons had determined their betrothal, a sincere love developed between the two young people, enlivened by faith and by the desire to do God’s will. On his father\'s death when Ludwig was 18 years old, he began to reign over Thuringia. Elizabeth, however, became the object of critical whispers because her behaviour was incongruous with court life. Hence their marriage celebrations were far from sumptuous and a part of the funds destined for the banquet was donated to the poor.\n<br />\n<br />\nWith her profound sensitivity, Elizabeth saw the contradictions between the faith professed and Christian practice. She could not bear compromise. Once, on entering a church on the Feast of the Assumption, she took off her crown, laid it before the Crucifix and, covering her face, lay prostrate on the ground. When her mother-in-law reprimanded her for this gesture, Elizabeth answered: \"How can I, a wretched creature, continue to wear a crown of earthly dignity, when I see my King Jesus Christ crowned with thorns?”\n<br />\n<br />\n\nShe behaved to her subjects in the same way that she behaved to God. Among the Sayings of the Four Maids we find this testimony: “She did not eat any food before ascertaining that it came from her husband\'s property or legitimate possessions. While she abstained from goods procured illegally, she also did her utmost to provide compensation to those who had suffered violence” (nn. 25 and 37).  She is the true example for all who have roles of leadership: the exercise of authority, at every level, must be lived as a service to justice and charity in the constant search for the common good.  Elizabeth diligently practiced works of mercy: she would give food and drink to those who knocked at her door, she procured clothing, paid debts, cared for the sick and buried the dead.  Coming down from her castle, she often visited the homes of the poor with her ladies-in-waiting, bringing them bread, meat, flour and other food.  She distributed the food personally and attentively checked the clothing and mattresses of the poor. This behaviour was reported to her husband, who not only was not displeased but answered her accusers, “So long as she does not sell the castle, I am happy with her!”.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe miracle of the loaves that were changed into roses fits into this context: while Elizabeth was on her way with her apron filled with bread for the poor, she met her husband who asked her what she was carrying. She opened her apron to show him and, instead of bread, it was full of magnificent roses. This symbol of charity often features in depictions of St Elizabeth.\n<br />\n<br />\nElizabeth\'s marriage was profoundly happy: she helped her husband to raise his human qualities to a supernatural level and he, in exchange, stood up for his wife\'s generosity to the poor and for her religious practices. Increasingly admired for his wife\'s great faith, Ludwig said to her, referring to her attention to the poor: “Dear Elizabeth, it is Christ whom you have cleansed, nourished and cared for”. A clear witness to how faith and love of God and neighbour strengthen family life and deepen ever more the matrimonial union.\nThe young couple found spiritual support in the Friars Minor who began to spread through Thuringia in 1222. Elizabeth chose from among them Friar Rodeger (Rüdiger) as her spiritual director. When he told her about the event of the conversion of Francis of Assisi, a rich young merchant, Elizabeth was even more enthusiastic in the journey of her Christian life.\n<br />\n<br />\nFrom that time she became even more determined to follow the poor and Crucified Christ, present in poor people. Even when her first son was born, followed by two other children, our Saint never neglected her charitable works. She also helped the Friars Minor to build a convent at Halberstadt, of which Friar Rodeger became superior. For this reason Elizabeth’s spiritual direction was taken on by Conrad of Marburg.\n<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Elizabeth-of-Hungary-Two.jpg\" style=\"padding-left:20px;float:right;\" />\nThe farewell to her husband was a hard trial, when, at the end of June in 1227 when Ludwig ivjoined the Crusade of the Emperor Frederick ii. He reminded his wife that this was traditional for the sovereigns of Thuringia. Elizabeth answered him: “Far be it from me to detain you. I have given my whole self to God and now I must also give you”.\n<br />\n<br />\nHowever, fever decimated the troops and Ludwig himself fell ill and died in Otranto, before embarking, in September 1227. He was 27 years old. When Elizabeth learned the news, she was so sorrowful that she withdrew in solitude; but then, strengthened by prayer and comforted by the hope of seeing him again in Heaven, she began to attend to the affairs of the Kingdom.\n<br />\n<br />\nHowever, another trial was lying in wait for Elizabeth. Her brother-in-law usurped the government of Thuringia, declaring himself to be the true heir of Ludwig and accusing Elizabeth of being a pious woman incapable of ruling. The young widow, with three children, was banished from the Castle of Wartburg and went in search of a place of refuge. Only two of her ladies remained close to her. They accompanied her and entrusted the three children to the care of Ludwig’s friends. Wandering through the villages, Elizabeth worked wherever she was welcomed, looked after the sick, spun thread and cooked.\n<br />\n<br />\nDuring this calvary which she bore with great faith, with patience and with dedication to God, a few relatives who had stayed faithful to her and viewed her brother-in-law\'s rule as illegal, restored her reputation. So it was that at the beginning of 1228, Elizabeth received sufficient income to withdraw to the family’s castle in Marburg, where her spiritual director, Fra Conrad, also lived.\n<br />\n<br />\nIt was he who reported the following event to Pope Gregory IX: “On Good Friday in 1228, having placed her hands on the altar in the chapel of her city, Eisenach, to which she had welcomed the Friars Minor, in the presence of several friars and relatives Elizabeth renounced her own will and all the vanities of the world. She also wanted to resign all her possessions, but I dissuaded her out of love for the poor. Shortly afterwards she built a hospital, gathered the sick and invalids and served at her own table the most wretched and deprived. When I reprimanded her for these things, Elizabeth answered that she received from the poor special grace and humility” (Epistula magistri Conradi, 14-17).\n<br />\n<br />\nWe can discern in this affirmation a certain mystical experience similar to that of St Francis: the Poverello of Assisi declared in his testament, in fact, that serving lepers, which he at first found repugnant, was transformed into sweetness of the soul and of the body (Testamentum, 1-3).\n<br />\n<br />\nElizabeth spent her last three years in the hospital she founded, serving the sick and keeping wake over the dying. She always tried to carry out the most humble services and repugnant tasks. She became what we might call a consecrated woman in the world (soror in saeculo) and, with other friends clothed in grey habits, formed a religious community. It is not by chance that she is the Patroness of the Third Order Regular of St Francis and of the Franciscan Secular Order.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn November 1231 she was stricken with a high fever. When the news of her illness spread, may people flocked to see her. After about 10 days, she asked for the doors to be closed so that she might be alone with God. In the night of 17 November, she fell asleep gently in the Lord. The testimonies of her holiness were so many and such that after only four years Pope Gregory IX canonized her and, that same year, the beautiful church built in her honour at Marburg was consecrated.\nDear brothers and sisters, in St Elizabeth we see how faith and friendship with Christ create a sense of justice, of the equality of all, of the rights of others and how they create love, charity. And from this charity is born hope too, the certainty that we are loved by Christ and that the love of Christ awaits us thereby rendering us capable of imitating Christ and of seeing Christ in others.\n<br />\n<br />\nSt Elizabeth invites us to rediscover Christ, to love him and to have faith; and thereby to find true justice and love, as well as the joy that one day we shall be immersed in divine love, in the joy of eternity with God.\n<br />\n<br />\nGiven by Pope Benedict XVI at the General Audience at St Peter’s Square, October 20, 2010\n<br />\n<br />\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Prayer</strong><br /><br />\nFather,<br />\nYou helped Elizabeth of Hungary<br />\nto recognize and honor Christ<br />\nin the poor of this world.<br />\nLet her prayers help us to serve our brothers and sisters<br />\nin time of trouble and need.<br />\nWe ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,<br />\nwho lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,<br />\none God, for ever and ever.

He lived for the welfare of his subjects and the glory of God. Louis was born in Poissy, France on 25 April 1215 to King Louis VIII, of the Capet line, and Blanche of Castile, daughter of King Alfonso of Castile and Eleanor of England. His father died when he was just eleven years old, and he was crowned -- at Rheims, like almost all French Kings -- on the First Sunday of Advent in 1226. His very strong and pious mother acted as his regent, suppressing various revolts to secure her son\'s place. She acted as regent even after he reached the age of majority, and guided his career with strong Christian advice, forming his character in holiness. Much of his virtue is attributed to his mother\'s care, for the Queen devoted herself to her children\'s education. Blanche\'s primary concern was to implant in him a deep regard and awe for everything related to religion. She would say to him, \"Never forget that sin is the only great evil in the world. No mother could love her son more than I love you. But I would rather see you lying dead at my feet than know that you had offended God by one mortal sin\" -- sentiments that he took to heart and would later pass on to his own son. (see below)\n<br />\n<br />\nOne of his first acts as king was to build the famous monastery of Royaumont, with funds left for the purpose by his father. Louis gave encouragement to the religious orders, installing the Carthusians in the palace of Vauvert in Paris, and assisting his mother in founding the convent of Maubuisson.\n<br />\n<br />\nLouis loved sermons, heard two Masses daily, and was surrounded, even while traveling, with priests chanting the hours. He forbade all forms of usury and protected vassals and tenants from cruel lords. In 1244, Louis announced his long-cherished intention of undertaking a crusade to the East. At first he was successful capturing the port city of Damietta, at the mouth of the Nile. Six months later in a battle with the Saracens at Mansourah his forces were defeated and he was captured. After length negotiations he and his fellow prisoners were released. Louis, with the remnant of his army, sailed to the Syrian coast and remained in that region until he return to France in 1254.\n<br />\n<br />\nHe was a great patron of learning, the arts, and architecture, and under his patronage, the famous college of theology, the Sorbonne was founded; abbeys built; and the chapel of Ste. Chapelle. This the beautiful chapel with the walls of stained glass that sits on the tiny Ile de la Cité right in the middle of Paris, in the Seine River (the same island where Notre Dame Cathedral is found). This chapel was built to house a part of the Crown of Thorns and a piece of the True Cross, which he purchased from Emperor Baldwin II in Constantinople, and it became St. Louis\'s personal royal chapel.\n<br />\n<br />\nLouis was very dedicated to the cause of peace, he not only arbitrated and made treaties with Henry VIII and James I of Aragon (The Peace of Paris), but did much to curb a lot of the petty, feudal warfare that caused so much harm. He was most famous for his charity, humility, and concern for the poor. He built many hospitals, among them the hospital known as \"Quinze-vingt\" (\"Fifteen-Twenty\") -- a hospital for the blind and whose name comes from the fact that it could care for 300 patients. He also received destitute people daily and saw that they were fed; in Lent and Advent he cared for all who came, often waiting on them in person. He had a passion for justice, and changed the \"King\'s court\" of his ancestors into a popular court, where he listened to any of his subjects who came with grievances and gave what seemed to them wise and impartial judgments. The feudal method of settling disputes by combat he tried to replace by peaceful arbitration or the judicial process of trial, with the presentation of testimony. In later times, whenever the French complained of oppression, their cry was for justice to be meted out impartially, as it had been in the reign of St. Louis.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn 1270, he went off on another Crusade, this time in an attempt to convert the Emir of Tunis after being inspired by acting as godfather to a Jewish convert. Again, his Crusade failed, and again he became sick with dysentery. This time, though, he did not recover. He died on 25 August 1270. His last words were those of Christ: \"Into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\" He was canonized in 1297, 27 years after his death.\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/King-Louis-IX-Two.jpg\" style=\"padding-left:20px;float:right;\" />\n<underline>King Saint Louis’s last Instructions to his Eldest Son, Philip III</underline>\n<br /><br />\nTherefore, dear son, the first thing I advise is that you fix your whole heart upon God, and love Him with all your strength, for without this no one can be saved or be of any worth.\n<br /><br />\nYou should, with all your strength, shun everything, which you believe to be displeasing to Him. And you ought especially to be resolved not to commit mortal sin, no matter what may happen and should permit all your limbs to be hewn off, and suffer every manner of torment, rather than fall knowingly into mortal sin.\n<br /><br />\nIf our Lord send you any adversity, whether illness or other in good patience, and thank Him for it, thing, you should receive it in good patience and be thankful for it, for you ought to believe that He will cause everything to turn out for your good; and likewise you should think that you have well merited it, and more also, should He will it, because you have loved Him but little, and served Him but little, and have done many things contrary to His will.\n<br /><br />\nIf our Lord send you any prosperity, either health of body or other thing you ought to thank Him humbly for it, and you ought to be careful that you are not the worse for it, either through pride or anything else, for it is a very great sin to fight against our Lord with His gifts.\n<br /><br />\nI advise you that you accustom yourself to frequent confession, and that you choose always, as your confessors, men who are upright and sufficiently learned, and who can teach you what you should do and what you should avoid. You should so carry yourself that your confessors and other friends may dare confidently to reprove you and show you your faults.\n<br /><br />\nIn conclusion, dear son, I give you all the blessings which a good and tender father can give to a son, and I pray our Lord Jesus Christ, by His mercy, by the prayers and merits of His blessed Mother, the Virgin Mary, and of angels and archangels and of all the saints, to guard and protect you from doing anything contrary to His will, and to give you grace to do it always, so that He may be honoured and served by you. And this may He do to me as to you, by His great bounty, so that after this mortal life we may be able to be together with Him in the eternal life, and see Him, love Him, and praise Him without end. Amen. And glory, honour, and praise be to Him who is one God with the Father and the Holy Spirit; without beginning and without end. Amen.\n<br /><br /></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[LLEN] The Life of Saint Louis IX of France','','inherit','closed','closed','','129-revision-v1','','','2020-09-29 17:55:16','2020-09-29 21:55:16','',129,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/09/29/129-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(427,1,'2020-09-29 18:07:12','2020-09-29 22:07:12','','History Clare','','inherit','','closed','','history-clare','','','2020-09-29 18:07:12','2020-09-29 22:07:12','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/History-Clare.jpeg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(428,1,'2020-09-29 18:07:12','2020-09-29 22:07:12','','History Elizabeth','','inherit','','closed','','history-elizabeth','','','2020-09-29 18:07:12','2020-09-29 22:07:12','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/History-Elizabeth.jpeg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(429,1,'2020-09-29 18:07:13','2020-09-29 22:07:13','','History Francis','','inherit','','closed','','history-francis','','','2020-09-29 18:07:13','2020-09-29 22:07:13','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/History-Francis.jpeg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(430,1,'2020-09-29 18:07:14','2020-09-29 22:07:14','','History Louis','','inherit','','closed','','history-louis','','','2020-09-29 18:07:14','2020-09-29 22:07:14','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/History-Louis.jpeg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(431,1,'2020-09-29 18:10:02','2020-09-29 22:10:02','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Franciscan History</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<table class=\"wsite-multicol-table\">\n	<tbody class=\"wsite-multicol-tbody\">\n		<tr class=\"wsite-multicol-tr\">\n			<td class=\"wsite-multicol-col\" style=\"width:33.966553191823%; padding:0 15px;\">\n								\n\n				<div class=\"paragraph\" style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong><font size=\"3\">THE FRANCISCAN CREED</font></strong><br>Inspired by the vision of Saint Francis<br>we commit ourselves to the&nbsp;Gospel as our way&nbsp;of life.

These experiences made St Francis grow in his passionate love of the poor and crucified Christ, until his complete conformity with Him on La Verna. The strong experience of God as Father and the Highest Good characterized the life of St Francis. It moved him to an attitude towards the Creator of gratitude and praise for His wonders and made him a brother to all people and to all creatures.\n<br/><br/>\nThe gift given to St Francis was that of beginning to do penance. This then involved a process of continuing conversion which changed to sweetness those things which before had seemed bitter. St Francis was in due course led to forsake the mentality and attitudes of this world, to despoil himself of his possessions and of himself in order to pass from a life centered on himself to a gradual conformity with Christ (cf. Test 1.3-4).\n<br/><br/>\nThe path followed by St Francis is a model for the life and formation of us Franciscans today, for we too are called to walk along the same road until we achieve the full stature of Christ (cf. Eph 4,13).\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n</td>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</tr></table>\n\n<h2>Principles of Franciscan Formation</h2>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<h3>General Principles</h3>\n\nThe Franciscan, under the grace of the Holy Spirit, is the chief protagonist of his or her own formation, responsible for accepting and making his own all the values of Franciscan life, capable of making his own decisions and exercising personal initiative.\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is a dynamic process of growth in which we open our heart to the Gospel in our daily life and commit ourselves fully to being continually converted so as to follow Jesus Christ ever more faithfully in the spirit of St Francis.\n<br/><br/>\nThe process of formation respects our unique individuality and the mystery that we bear in ourselves through our particular gifts, encouraging us to grow through knowing ourselves and discovering the will of God.\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation takes place in our Fraternity and in the real world. It is here that we experience the power of grace, are renewed in mind and heart, and develop our evangelizing vocation. Such Franciscan formation is ever alert to our human, Christian, and Franciscan growth, in order that we may follow Jesus Christ wholeheartedly, after the manner of Francis.\n\n\n</td>¸<td width=\"%50\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n\n<h3>Specific Principles</h3>\nFranciscan formation stresses elements of our Franciscan charism (prayerfulness, simplicity, humility, an awe of creation, penitential, and working for social justice and peace)\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is holistic, that is to say it takes into account our whole person, in order that we may develop harmoniously our physical, mental, moral, and intellectual gifts, and may integrate ourselves positively in social and community life\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is a journey during which the fundamental aspects of our consecrated life are cultivated.

These experiences made St Francis grow in his passionate love of the poor and crucified Christ, until his complete conformity with Him on La Verna. The strong experience of God as Father and the Highest Good characterized the life of St Francis. It moved him to an attitude towards the Creator of gratitude and praise for His wonders and made him a brother to all people and to all creatures.\n<br/><br/>\nThe gift given to St Francis was that of beginning to do penance. This then involved a process of continuing conversion which changed to sweetness those things which before had seemed bitter. St Francis was in due course led to forsake the mentality and attitudes of this world, to despoil himself of his possessions and of himself in order to pass from a life centered on himself to a gradual conformity with Christ (cf. Test 1.3-4).\n<br/><br/>\nThe path followed by St Francis is a model for the life and formation of us Franciscans today, for we too are called to walk along the same road until we achieve the full stature of Christ (cf. Eph 4,13).\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n</td>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</tr></table>\n\n<h2>Principles of Franciscan Formation</h2>\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;\">\n<h3>General Principles</h3>\n\nThe Franciscan, under the grace of the Holy Spirit, is the chief protagonist of his or her own formation, responsible for accepting and making his own all the values of Franciscan life, capable of making his own decisions and exercising personal initiative.\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation is a dynamic process of growth in which we open our heart to the Gospel in our daily life and commit ourselves fully to being continually converted so as to follow Jesus Christ ever more faithfully in the spirit of St Francis.\n<br/><br/>\nThe process of formation respects our unique individuality and the mystery that we bear in ourselves through our particular gifts, encouraging us to grow through knowing ourselves and discovering the will of God.\n<br/><br/>\nFranciscan formation takes place in our Fraternity and in the real world. It is here that we experience the power of grace, are renewed in mind and heart, and develop our evangelizing vocation.

She was born of nobility, the oldest child of Ortulana and Favarone di Offreduccio.  At the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century, Italy was a cauldron of political and military strife. Society was divided into two groups: the maiores and minores. The maiores were the nobility. The minores were former serfs, who had become merchants, craftsmen and field workers. These two groups were continually fighting for power among themselves.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn her early youth, Clare was exiled to Perugia. While the men in the family were off fighting their wars, the women chose to live as penitents. Ortulana, along with her daughters, as well as other women among Clare\'s family and friends, were fasting, praying, bringing food to the poor and visiting prisoners.  This time of suffering and exile became a time of spiritual formation. Many of the women living with Clare in Perugia, including her mother and sisters, later became some of Clare\'s first followers in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Damiano,_Assisi\">San Damiano<a/>.\n</p>\n<p>In 1205, Clare\'s family returned to Assisi. Francis had already begun his conversion. He had publicly renounced his father and started rebuilding San Damiano. In 1208, he began preaching. Clare\'s cousin Rufino became one of his early followers.  Clare\'s household had to have experienced the stir that Francis was causing. An eyewitness, cited in the Acts of the Process of Canonization [of Clare], said that, during this time, Clare went to hear Francis preach, gave him some money to rebuild churches and to feed the poor, and arranged to talk to him in private.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare and Francis were both experiencing God breaking into their lives, changing them and calling them to give themselves over to God. Both were facing unknowns and both were probably frightened and unsure of themselves. It must have been a comforting grace to meet a kindred spirit and to encounter another human being who was experiencing the same call and facing the same doubts. Clare\'s sister Beatrice tells us (in the document of the canonization process) that Francis first initiated the visit with Clare. Some speculation suggests that women were asking to join his movement and Francis needed a strong woman to lead the others.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s reputation for holiness was well known in Assisi. She would be the perfect leader. Who went to whom first is unimportant. The important reality was that God had a plan and that Francis and Clare were open to being led.  Francis and the brothers received Clare on Palm Sunday night at the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels (the Portiuncula) in the year 1212. Shortly after this, she was taken to San Paolo, a Benedictine monastery in Bastia.  The men in Clare\'s family were not happy with her following Francis. Their power and wealth were diminishing with the changes in society. Clare was beautiful and they had hoped that her marriage would bring prestige and continued wealth into the family. They followed her to San Paolo with every intention of bringing her home.  Clare instead held on to the altar and claimed sanctuary. She had made her choice. She would never turn back.  Clare\'s sister Catherine, soon to be called Agnes, joined Clare. The two lived for a while with a group of Beguines (13th-century women under vows) in Sant\'Angelo in Panzo until Francis brought them to the church of San Damiano. There, the Lord gave them sisters and their community grew quickly.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s community was to be vastly different from the monastic communities of her time. The sisters were to live poorly without large land holdings. Like Francis, their Rule would be to embrace the gospel form of life. They would all be of equal rank, and all decisions affecting their life would be made by all of them.  They would have an abbess, but she would consider herself \"the servant of the sisters\" and she would lead more by her example of virtue than by instruction or admonition.  Clare was the perfect follower of Francis. She understood his message and would spend her entire life making it a lived reality. Her life and the lives of the early sisters, however, were not easy ones.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrancis died young. Clare outlived him by 27 years. She remained firm and kept the ideal alive, despite Francis\' absence and the dissension among his brothers. The Church would see the poverty of her life as too difficult. She negotiated with popes and worked to get her Rule approved until the day before she died—August 10, 1253.\nWithin the context of the medieval world of the 13th century, Clare lived and struggled with many of the issues that are present in our day. She was a woman of strength and courage, of wisdom and insight, of patience and with an innate gift of leadership. Looking closely at her, we can learn much about the response to life that enables us to be free in a world where oppression abounds. As a medieval woman born into a rich and powerful family, her role in life was defined for her when she was still a child by the men who ruled the clan. She would be married to a man of their choosing, someone whose assets and social standing would make the clan even more powerful. Her wishes were considered irrelevant, until the day she sold her inheritance, instantly making her worthless in the marriage market.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s society was rigidly stratified. She broke down those class structures by insisting that everyone work with their hands and that everyone was equal in every way. Without hesitation, she swept away all the artificial class distinctions that society had created and which led to wars and violence. Clare has much to teach us about living together on our planet earth as sisters and brothers, all children of the one God.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare understood the links between money and power. Economic freedom equals social freedom which in this context paves the way for spiritual freedom. Clare\'s life of absolute poverty cuts through all the enticements of our consumerist culture. Clare exhorted her sisters who served outside the monastery to: Praise God for every green and flowering plant that you see; for every human person and for every creature. The environmental crisis is the result of a lack of care and reverence for the good things that God has given us for our use and our happiness. In beholding a flower, a sunset, the vast ocean, the varieties of animals, the sun, moon, stars, human beings so often fail to see, as Clare did, the reflection of a loving Creator of all these wonders.\n<br>\n<br>\nHer wisdom and holiness were recognized far and wide, and Popes and prelates came to her to recommend themselves to her prayer. In our contemporary world, women all over the globe are experiencing their worth and dignity in a new way and are struggling to resist the forces of oppression and domination which perpetuate the evil of unhealthy dependence. In this struggle Clare has much to teach all of us.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare is as relevant today as she was in the thirteenth century. Perhaps even more so because like all holy people, she was a prophet whose message is timeless.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Clair-Two.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[FCEN] The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi','','inherit','closed','closed','','124-revision-v1','','','2020-10-12 12:44:51','2020-10-12 16:44:51','',124,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/10/12/124-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(441,1,'2020-10-12 12:46:47','2020-10-12 16:46:47','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Clair.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\">Clare was born in 1193 in Assisi, a small town in the scenic Umbrian Valley of Italy.

She was born of nobility, the oldest child of Ortulana and Favarone di Offreduccio.  At the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century, Italy was a cauldron of political and military strife. Society was divided into two groups: the maiores and minores. The maiores were the nobility. The minores were former serfs, who had become merchants, craftsmen and field workers. These two groups were continually fighting for power among themselves.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn her early youth, Clare was exiled to Perugia. While the men in the family were off fighting their wars, the women chose to live as penitents. Ortulana, along with her daughters, as well as other women among Clare\'s family and friends, were fasting, praying, bringing food to the poor and visiting prisoners.  This time of suffering and exile became a time of spiritual formation. Many of the women living with Clare in Perugia, including her mother and sisters, later became some of Clare\'s first followers in <a  href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Damiano,_Assisi\">San Damiano</a>.\n</p>\n<p>In 1205, Clare\'s family returned to Assisi. Francis had already begun his conversion. He had publicly renounced his father and started rebuilding San Damiano. In 1208, he began preaching. Clare\'s cousin Rufino became one of his early followers.  Clare\'s household had to have experienced the stir that Francis was causing. An eyewitness, cited in the Acts of the Process of Canonization [of Clare], said that, during this time, Clare went to hear Francis preach, gave him some money to rebuild churches and to feed the poor, and arranged to talk to him in private.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare and Francis were both experiencing God breaking into their lives, changing them and calling them to give themselves over to God. Both were facing unknowns and both were probably frightened and unsure of themselves. It must have been a comforting grace to meet a kindred spirit and to encounter another human being who was experiencing the same call and facing the same doubts. Clare\'s sister Beatrice tells us (in the document of the canonization process) that Francis first initiated the visit with Clare. Some speculation suggests that women were asking to join his movement and Francis needed a strong woman to lead the others.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s reputation for holiness was well known in Assisi. She would be the perfect leader. Who went to whom first is unimportant. The important reality was that God had a plan and that Francis and Clare were open to being led.  Francis and the brothers received Clare on Palm Sunday night at the chapel of <a href=\"https://www.piercedhearts.org/treasures/holy_sites/portiuncula.htm\">St. Mary of the Angels (the Portiuncula)</a> in the year 1212. Shortly after this, she was taken to San Paolo, a Benedictine monastery in Bastia.  The men in Clare\'s family were not happy with her following Francis. Their power and wealth were diminishing with the changes in society. Clare was beautiful and they had hoped that her marriage would bring prestige and continued wealth into the family. They followed her to San Paolo with every intention of bringing her home.  Clare instead held on to the altar and claimed sanctuary. She had made her choice. She would never turn back.  Clare\'s sister Catherine, soon to be called Agnes, joined Clare. The two lived for a while with a group of Beguines (13th-century women under vows) in Sant\'Angelo in Panzo until Francis brought them to the church of San Damiano. There, the Lord gave them sisters and their community grew quickly.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s community was to be vastly different from the monastic communities of her time. The sisters were to live poorly without large land holdings. Like Francis, their Rule would be to embrace the gospel form of life. They would all be of equal rank, and all decisions affecting their life would be made by all of them.  They would have an abbess, but she would consider herself \"the servant of the sisters\" and she would lead more by her example of virtue than by instruction or admonition.  Clare was the perfect follower of Francis. She understood his message and would spend her entire life making it a lived reality. Her life and the lives of the early sisters, however, were not easy ones.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrancis died young. Clare outlived him by 27 years. She remained firm and kept the ideal alive, despite Francis\' absence and the dissension among his brothers. The Church would see the poverty of her life as too difficult.

She was a woman of strength and courage, of wisdom and insight, of patience and with an innate gift of leadership. Looking closely at her, we can learn much about the response to life that enables us to be free in a world where oppression abounds. As a medieval woman born into a rich and powerful family, her role in life was defined for her when she was still a child by the men who ruled the clan. She would be married to a man of their choosing, someone whose assets and social standing would make the clan even more powerful. Her wishes were considered irrelevant, until the day she sold her inheritance, instantly making her worthless in the marriage market.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s society was rigidly stratified. She broke down those class structures by insisting that everyone work with their hands and that everyone was equal in every way. Without hesitation, she swept away all the artificial class distinctions that society had created and which led to wars and violence. Clare has much to teach us about living together on our planet earth as sisters and brothers, all children of the one God.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare understood the links between money and power. Economic freedom equals social freedom which in this context paves the way for spiritual freedom. Clare\'s life of absolute poverty cuts through all the enticements of our consumerist culture. Clare exhorted her sisters who served outside the monastery to: Praise God for every green and flowering plant that you see; for every human person and for every creature. The environmental crisis is the result of a lack of care and reverence for the good things that God has given us for our use and our happiness. In beholding a flower, a sunset, the vast ocean, the varieties of animals, the sun, moon, stars, human beings so often fail to see, as Clare did, the reflection of a loving Creator of all these wonders.\n<br>\n<br>\nHer wisdom and holiness were recognized far and wide, and Popes and prelates came to her to recommend themselves to her prayer. In our contemporary world, women all over the globe are experiencing their worth and dignity in a new way and are struggling to resist the forces of oppression and domination which perpetuate the evil of unhealthy dependence. In this struggle Clare has much to teach all of us.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare is as relevant today as she was in the thirteenth century.

Many of the women living with Clare in Perugia, including her mother and sisters, later became some of Clare\'s first followers in <a  href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Damiano,_Assisi\">San Damiano</a>.\n</p>\n<p>In 1205, Clare\'s family returned to Assisi. Francis had already begun his conversion. He had publicly renounced his father and started rebuilding San Damiano. In 1208, he began preaching. Clare\'s cousin Rufino became one of his early followers.  Clare\'s household had to have experienced the stir that Francis was causing. An eyewitness, cited in the Acts of the Process of Canonization [of Clare], said that, during this time, Clare went to hear Francis preach, gave him some money to rebuild churches and to feed the poor, and arranged to talk to him in private.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare and Francis were both experiencing God breaking into their lives, changing them and calling them to give themselves over to God. Both were facing unknowns and both were probably frightened and unsure of themselves. It must have been a comforting grace to meet a kindred spirit and to encounter another human being who was experiencing the same call and facing the same doubts. Clare\'s sister Beatrice tells us (in the document of the canonization process) that Francis first initiated the visit with Clare. Some speculation suggests that women were asking to join his movement and Francis needed a strong woman to lead the others.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s reputation for holiness was well known in Assisi. She would be the perfect leader. Who went to whom first is unimportant. The important reality was that God had a plan and that Francis and Clare were open to being led.  Francis and the brothers received Clare on Palm Sunday night at the chapel of <a href=\"https://www.piercedhearts.org/treasures/holy_sites/portiuncula.htm\">St. Mary of the Angels (the Portiuncula)</a> in the year 1212. Shortly after this, she was taken to San Paolo, a Benedictine monastery in Bastia.  The men in Clare\'s family were not happy with her following Francis. Their power and wealth were diminishing with the changes in society. Clare was beautiful and they had hoped that her marriage would bring prestige and continued wealth into the family. They followed her to San Paolo with every intention of bringing her home.  Clare instead held on to the altar and claimed sanctuary. She had made her choice. She would never turn back.  Clare\'s sister Catherine, soon to be called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_Assisi\">Agnes</a>, joined Clare. The two lived for a while with a group of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beguines_and_Beghards\">Beguines</a> (13th-century women under vows) in Sant\'Angelo in Panzo until Francis brought them to the church of San Damiano. There, the Lord gave them sisters and their community grew quickly.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s community was to be vastly different from the monastic communities of her time. The sisters were to live poorly without large land holdings. Like Francis, their Rule would be to embrace the gospel form of life. They would all be of equal rank, and all decisions affecting their life would be made by all of them.  They would have an abbess, but she would consider herself \"the servant of the sisters\" and she would lead more by her example of virtue than by instruction or admonition.  Clare was the perfect follower of Francis. She understood his message and would spend her entire life making it a lived reality. Her life and the lives of the early sisters, however, were not easy ones.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrancis died young. Clare outlived him by 27 years. She remained firm and kept the ideal alive, despite Francis\' absence and the dissension among his brothers. The Church would see the poverty of her life as too difficult. She negotiated with popes and worked to get her Rule approved until the day before she died—August 10, 1253.\nWithin the context of the medieval world of the 13th century, Clare lived and struggled with many of the issues that are present in our day. She was a woman of strength and courage, of wisdom and insight, of patience and with an innate gift of leadership. Looking closely at her, we can learn much about the response to life that enables us to be free in a world where oppression abounds. As a medieval woman born into a rich and powerful family, her role in life was defined for her when she was still a child by the men who ruled the clan. She would be married to a man of their choosing, someone whose assets and social standing would make the clan even more powerful. Her wishes were considered irrelevant, until the day she sold her inheritance, instantly making her worthless in the marriage market.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare\'s society was rigidly stratified. She broke down those class structures by insisting that everyone work with their hands and that everyone was equal in every way. Without hesitation, she swept away all the artificial class distinctions that society had created and which led to wars and violence. Clare has much to teach us about living together on our planet earth as sisters and brothers, all children of the one God.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare understood the links between money and power. Economic freedom equals social freedom which in this context paves the way for spiritual freedom. Clare\'s life of absolute poverty cuts through all the enticements of our consumerist culture. Clare exhorted her sisters who served outside the monastery to: Praise God for every green and flowering plant that you see; for every human person and for every creature. The environmental crisis is the result of a lack of care and reverence for the good things that God has given us for our use and our happiness. In beholding a flower, a sunset, the vast ocean, the varieties of animals, the sun, moon, stars, human beings so often fail to see, as Clare did, the reflection of a loving Creator of all these wonders.\n<br>\n<br>\nHer wisdom and holiness were recognized far and wide, and Popes and prelates came to her to recommend themselves to her prayer. In our contemporary world, women all over the globe are experiencing their worth and dignity in a new way and are struggling to resist the forces of oppression and domination which perpetuate the evil of unhealthy dependence. In this struggle Clare has much to teach all of us.\n<br>\n<br>\nClare is as relevant today as she was in the thirteenth century. Perhaps even more so because like all holy people, she was a prophet whose message is timeless.\n</p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Life-Of-Saint-Clair-Two.jpg\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[FCEN] The Life of Saint Clare of Assisi','','inherit','closed','closed','','124-revision-v1','','','2020-10-12 12:55:20','2020-10-12 16:55:20','',124,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/10/12/124-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(449,1,'2020-10-12 13:00:05','2020-10-12 17:00:05','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Life of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Elizabeth-of-Hungary-One.jpg\" style=\"float:left;padding-right:20px;\">\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_of_Hungary#:~:text=Elizabeth%20of%20Hungary%20%28%20German%3A%20Heilige%20Elisabeth%20von,by%20which%20she%20is%20honored%20as%20its%20patroness\">Elizabeth</a> was born in 1207; historians dispute her birthplace. Her father was Andrew II, the rich and powerful King of Hungary. To reinforce political ties he had married the German Countess Gertrude of Andechs-Meran, sister of St Hedwig who was wife to the Duke of Silesia. Elizabeth, together with her sister and three brothers, spent only the first four years of her childhood at the Hungarian court. She liked playing, music and dancing; she recited her prayers faithfully and already showed special attention to the poor, whom she helped with a kind word or an affectionate gesture.\n<br>\n<br>\nHer happy childhood was suddenly interrupted when some knights arrived from distant Thuringia to escort her to her new residence in Central Germany. In fact, complying with the customs of that time, Elizabeth\'s father had arranged for her to become a Princess of Thuringia. The Landgrave or Count of this region was one of the richest and most influential sovereigns in Europe at the beginning of the 13th century and his castle was a centre of magnificence and culture.\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, the festivities and apparent glory concealed the ambition of feudal princes who were frequently warring with each other and in conflict with the royal and imperial authorities. In this context the Landgrave Hermann very willingly accepted the betrothal of his son Ludwig to the Hungarian Princess. Elizabeth left her homeland with a rich dowry and a large entourage, including her personal ladies-in-waiting, two of whom were to remain faithful friends to the very end. It is they who left us the precious information on the childhood and life of the Saint.\n<br>\n<br>\nThey reached Eisenach after a long journey and made the ascent to the Fortress of Wartburg, the strong castle towering over the city. It was here that the betrothal of Ludwig and Elizabeth was celebrated. In the ensuing years, while Ludwig learned the knightly profession, Elizabeth and her companions studied German, French, Latin, music, literature and embroidery. Despite the fact that political reasons had determined their betrothal, a sincere love developed between the two young people, enlivened by faith and by the desire to do God’s will. On his father\'s death when Ludwig was 18 years old, he began to reign over Thuringia. Elizabeth, however, became the object of critical whispers because her behaviour was incongruous with court life. Hence their marriage celebrations were far from sumptuous and a part of the funds destined for the banquet was donated to the poor.\n<br>\n<br>\nWith her profound sensitivity, Elizabeth saw the contradictions between the faith professed and Christian practice. She could not bear compromise. Once, on entering a church on the Feast of the Assumption, she took off her crown, laid it before the Crucifix and, covering her face, lay prostrate on the ground. When her mother-in-law reprimanded her for this gesture, Elizabeth answered: \"How can I, a wretched creature, continue to wear a crown of earthly dignity, when I see my King Jesus Christ crowned with thorns?”\n<br>\n<br>\n\nShe behaved to her subjects in the same way that she behaved to God. Among the Sayings of the Four Maids we find this testimony: “She did not eat any food before ascertaining that it came from her husband\'s property or legitimate possessions. While she abstained from goods procured illegally, she also did her utmost to provide compensation to those who had suffered violence” (nn. 25 and 37).  She is the true example for all who have roles of leadership: the exercise of authority, at every level, must be lived as a service to justice and charity in the constant search for the common good.  Elizabeth diligently practiced works of mercy: she would give food and drink to those who knocked at her door, she procured clothing, paid debts, cared for the sick and buried the dead.  Coming down from her castle, she often visited the homes of the poor with her ladies-in-waiting, bringing them bread, meat, flour and other food.  She distributed the food personally and attentively checked the clothing and mattresses of the poor. This behaviour was reported to her husband, who not only was not displeased but answered her accusers, “So long as she does not sell the castle, I am happy with her!”.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe miracle of the loaves that were changed into roses fits into this context: while Elizabeth was on her way with her apron filled with bread for the poor, she met her husband who asked her what she was carrying. She opened her apron to show him and, instead of bread, it was full of magnificent roses. This symbol of charity often features in depictions of St Elizabeth.\n<br>\n<br>\nElizabeth\'s marriage was profoundly happy: she helped her husband to raise his human qualities to a supernatural level and he, in exchange, stood up for his wife\'s generosity to the poor and for her religious practices. Increasingly admired for his wife\'s great faith, Ludwig said to her, referring to her attention to the poor: “Dear Elizabeth, it is Christ whom you have cleansed, nourished and cared for”. A clear witness to how faith and love of God and neighbour strengthen family life and deepen ever more the matrimonial union.\nThe young couple found spiritual support in the Friars Minor who began to spread through Thuringia in 1222. Elizabeth chose from among them Friar Rodeger (Rüdiger) as her spiritual director. When he told her about the event of the conversion of Francis of Assisi, a rich young merchant, Elizabeth was even more enthusiastic in the journey of her Christian life.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrom that time she became even more determined to follow the poor and Crucified Christ, present in poor people. Even when her first son was born, followed by two other children, our Saint never neglected her charitable works. She also helped the Friars Minor to build a convent at Halberstadt, of which Friar Rodeger became superior. For this reason Elizabeth’s spiritual direction was taken on by Conrad of Marburg.\n<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Elizabeth-of-Hungary-Two.jpg\" style=\"padding-left:20px;float:right;\">\nThe farewell to her husband was a hard trial, when, at the end of June in 1227 when Ludwig ivjoined the Crusade of the Emperor Frederick ii. He reminded his wife that this was traditional for the sovereigns of Thuringia. Elizabeth answered him: “Far be it from me to detain you. I have given my whole self to God and now I must also give you”.\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, fever decimated the troops and Ludwig himself fell ill and died in Otranto, before embarking, in September 1227. He was 27 years old. When Elizabeth learned the news, she was so sorrowful that she withdrew in solitude; but then, strengthened by prayer and comforted by the hope of seeing him again in Heaven, she began to attend to the affairs of the Kingdom.\n<br>\n<br>\nHowever, another trial was lying in wait for Elizabeth. Her brother-in-law usurped the government of Thuringia, declaring himself to be the true heir of Ludwig and accusing Elizabeth of being a pious woman incapable of ruling. The young widow, with three children, was banished from the Castle of Wartburg and went in search of a place of refuge. Only two of her ladies remained close to her. They accompanied her and entrusted the three children to the care of Ludwig’s friends. Wandering through the villages, Elizabeth worked wherever she was welcomed, looked after the sick, spun thread and cooked.\n<br>\n<br>\nDuring this calvary which she bore with great faith, with patience and with dedication to God, a few relatives who had stayed faithful to her and viewed her brother-in-law\'s rule as illegal, restored her reputation. So it was that at the beginning of 1228, Elizabeth received sufficient income to withdraw to the family’s castle in Marburg, where her spiritual director, Fra Conrad, also lived.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt was he who reported the following event to Pope Gregory IX: “On Good Friday in 1228, having placed her hands on the altar in the chapel of her city, Eisenach, to which she had welcomed the Friars Minor, in the presence of several friars and relatives Elizabeth renounced her own will and all the vanities of the world. She also wanted to resign all her possessions, but I dissuaded her out of love for the poor. Shortly afterwards she built a hospital, gathered the sick and invalids and served at her own table the most wretched and deprived. When I reprimanded her for these things, Elizabeth answered that she received from the poor special grace and humility” (Epistula magistri Conradi, 14-17).\n<br>\n<br>\nWe can discern in this affirmation a certain mystical experience similar to that of St Francis: the Poverello of Assisi declared in his testament, in fact, that serving lepers, which he at first found repugnant, was transformed into sweetness of the soul and of the body (Testamentum, 1-3).\n<br>\n<br>\nElizabeth spent her last three years in the hospital she founded, serving the sick and keeping wake over the dying. She always tried to carry out the most humble services and repugnant tasks. She became what we might call a consecrated woman in the world (soror in saeculo) and, with other friends clothed in grey habits, formed a religious community. It is not by chance that she is the Patroness of the Third Order Regular of St Francis and of the Franciscan Secular Order.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn November 1231 she was stricken with a high fever. When the news of her illness spread, may people flocked to see her. After about 10 days, she asked for the doors to be closed so that she might be alone with God. In the night of 17 November, she fell asleep gently in the Lord. The testimonies of her holiness were so many and such that after only four years Pope Gregory IX canonized her and, that same year, the beautiful church built in her honour at Marburg was consecrated.\nDear brothers and sisters, in St Elizabeth we see how faith and friendship with Christ create a sense of justice, of the equality of all, of the rights of others and how they create love, charity. And from this charity is born hope too, the certainty that we are loved by Christ and that the love of Christ awaits us thereby rendering us capable of imitating Christ and of seeing Christ in others.\n<br>\n<br>\nSt Elizabeth invites us to rediscover Christ, to love him and to have faith; and thereby to find true justice and love, as well as the joy that one day we shall be immersed in divine love, in the joy of eternity with God.\n<br>\n<br>\nGiven by Pope Benedict XVI at the General Audience at St Peter’s Square, October 20, 2010\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Prayer</strong><br><br>\nFather,<br>\nYou helped Elizabeth of Hungary<br>\nto recognize and honor Christ<br>\nin the poor of this world.<br>\nLet her prayers help us to serve our brothers and sisters<br>\nin time of trouble and need.<br>\nWe ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son,<br>\nwho lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>\none God, for ever and ever.

He lived for the welfare of his subjects and the glory of God. Louis was born in Poissy, France on 25 April 1215 to King Louis VIII, of the Capet line, and Blanche of Castile, daughter of King Alfonso of Castile and Eleanor of England. His father died when he was just eleven years old, and he was crowned -- at Rheims, like almost all French Kings -- on the First Sunday of Advent in 1226. His very strong and pious mother acted as his regent, suppressing various revolts to secure her son\'s place. She acted as regent even after he reached the age of majority, and guided his career with strong Christian advice, forming his character in holiness. Much of his virtue is attributed to his mother\'s care, for the Queen devoted herself to her children\'s education. Blanche\'s primary concern was to implant in him a deep regard and awe for everything related to religion. She would say to him, \"Never forget that sin is the only great evil in the world. No mother could love her son more than I love you. But I would rather see you lying dead at my feet than know that you had offended God by one mortal sin\" -- sentiments that he took to heart and would later pass on to his own son. (see below)\n<br>\n<br>\nOne of his first acts as king was to build the famous monastery of Royaumont, with funds left for the purpose by his father. Louis gave encouragement to the religious orders, installing the Carthusians in the palace of Vauvert in Paris, and assisting his mother in founding the convent of Maubuisson.\n<br>\n<br>\nLouis loved sermons, heard two Masses daily, and was surrounded, even while traveling, with priests chanting the hours. He forbade all forms of usury and protected vassals and tenants from cruel lords. In 1244, Louis announced his long-cherished intention of undertaking a crusade to the East. At first he was successful capturing the port city of Damietta, at the mouth of the Nile. Six months later in a battle with the Saracens at Mansourah his forces were defeated and he was captured. After length negotiations he and his fellow prisoners were released. Louis, with the remnant of his army, sailed to the Syrian coast and remained in that region until he return to France in 1254.\n<br>\n<br>\nHe was a great patron of learning, the arts, and architecture, and under his patronage, the famous college of theology, the Sorbonne was founded; abbeys built; and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Chapelle\">chapel of Ste. Chapelle</a>. This the beautiful chapel with the walls of stained glass that sits on the tiny Ile de la Cité right in the middle of Paris, in the Seine River (the same island where Notre Dame Cathedral is found). This chapel was built to house a part of the Crown of Thorns and a piece of the True Cross, which he purchased from Emperor Baldwin II in Constantinople, and it became St. Louis\'s personal royal chapel.\n<br>\n<br>\nLouis was very dedicated to the cause of peace, he not only arbitrated and made treaties with Henry VIII and James I of Aragon (The Peace of Paris), but did much to curb a lot of the petty, feudal warfare that caused so much harm. He was most famous for his charity, humility, and concern for the poor. He built many hospitals, among them the hospital known as \"Quinze-vingt\" (\"Fifteen-Twenty\") -- a hospital for the blind and whose name comes from the fact that it could care for 300 patients. He also received destitute people daily and saw that they were fed; in Lent and Advent he cared for all who came, often waiting on them in person. He had a passion for justice, and changed the \"King\'s court\" of his ancestors into a popular court, where he listened to any of his subjects who came with grievances and gave what seemed to them wise and impartial judgments. The feudal method of settling disputes by combat he tried to replace by peaceful arbitration or the judicial process of trial, with the presentation of testimony. In later times, whenever the French complained of oppression, their cry was for justice to be meted out impartially, as it had been in the reign of St. Louis.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn 1270, he went off on another Crusade, this time in an attempt to convert the Emir of Tunis after being inspired by acting as godfather to a Jewish convert. Again, his Crusade failed, and again he became sick with dysentery. This time, though, he did not recover. He died on 25 August 1270. His last words were those of Christ: \"Into Thy hands I commend my spirit.\" He was canonized in 1297, 27 years after his death.\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/King-Louis-IX-Two.jpg\" style=\"padding-left:20px;float:right;\">\n<underline>King Saint Louis’s last Instructions to his Eldest Son, Philip III</underline>\n<br><br>\nTherefore, dear son, the first thing I advise is that you fix your whole heart upon God, and love Him with all your strength, for without this no one can be saved or be of any worth.\n<br><br>\nYou should, with all your strength, shun everything, which you believe to be displeasing to Him. And you ought especially to be resolved not to commit mortal sin, no matter what may happen and should permit all your limbs to be hewn off, and suffer every manner of torment, rather than fall knowingly into mortal sin.\n<br><br>\nIf our Lord send you any adversity, whether illness or other in good patience, and thank Him for it, thing, you should receive it in good patience and be thankful for it, for you ought to believe that He will cause everything to turn out for your good; and likewise you should think that you have well merited it, and more also, should He will it, because you have loved Him but little, and served Him but little, and have done many things contrary to His will.\n<br><br>\nIf our Lord send you any prosperity, either health of body or other thing you ought to thank Him humbly for it, and you ought to be careful that you are not the worse for it, either through pride or anything else, for it is a very great sin to fight against our Lord with His gifts.\n<br><br>\nI advise you that you accustom yourself to frequent confession, and that you choose always, as your confessors, men who are upright and sufficiently learned, and who can teach you what you should do and what you should avoid. You should so carry yourself that your confessors and other friends may dare confidently to reprove you and show you your faults.\n<br><br>\nIn conclusion, dear son, I give you all the blessings which a good and tender father can give to a son, and I pray our Lord Jesus Christ, by His mercy, by the prayers and merits of His blessed Mother, the Virgin Mary, and of angels and archangels and of all the saints, to guard and protect you from doing anything contrary to His will, and to give you grace to do it always, so that He may be honoured and served by you. And this may He do to me as to you, by His great bounty, so that after this mortal life we may be able to be together with Him in the eternal life, and see Him, love Him, and praise Him without end. Amen. And glory, honour, and praise be to Him who is one God with the Father and the Holy Spirit; without beginning and without end. Amen.\n<br><br></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[LLEN] The Life of Saint Louis IX of France','','inherit','closed','closed','','129-revision-v1','','','2020-10-12 13:07:57','2020-10-12 17:07:57','',129,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/10/12/129-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(454,1,'2020-10-12 13:08:09','2020-10-12 17:08:09','','National Formation Objectives One','','inherit','','closed','','national-formation-objectives-one','','','2020-10-12 13:08:09','2020-10-12 17:08:09','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/National-Formation-Objectives-One.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(455,1,'2020-10-12 13:08:23','2020-10-12 17:08:23','','National Formation Objectives Two','','inherit','','closed','','national-formation-objectives-two','','','2020-10-12 13:08:23','2020-10-12 17:08:23','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/National-Formation-Objectives-Two.jpeg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(457,1,'2020-10-12 13:09:55','2020-10-12 17:09:55','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>National Formation Objectives<h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/National-Formation-Objectives-One.png\" style=\"\">\n</td>\n<td>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<h2>INITIAL FORMATION PROGRAM OF THE SFO OF CANADA</h2>\n<strong>General Objective</strong><br />\nTo respond to the call of Christ in the manner and spirit of St. Francis (Rule, Article 1)<br />\n<strong>Final Objective #

Aspects that are essential in the first phase, <strong>ORIENTATION</strong> will still be essential in the second, <strong>INQUIRY</strong> the third, <strong>CANDIDACY</strong> and into the <a \n href=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/en/fpen-formation-process/\">Ongoing Formation</a> of <strong>PROFESSED MEMBERS</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Secular Franciscan Order, as all religious orders, has its <a href=\"https://secularfranciscansusa.org/the-rule-of-the-secular-franciscan-order/\">Rule</a> and General Constitution, the charism of the founders and the mission give to it by the Church. Our current Rule was approved by Pope Paul VI on June 24,1978.\n<br />\n<br />\nMembership in the Secular Franciscan Order is achieved through a journey, a time of formation. During the formative period candidates are invited to search out the will of God for them through study, prayer and reflection. The Fraternity provides an environment in which candidates experience more deeply the evangelical life, establish fraternal relationships and find ways for a more fruitful involvement in the life and the mission of the Church.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn Fraternities formation is \"carried out with frequent meetings for study and prayer and with concrete experiences of service and of apostolate\" (GC art. 40:1). During formation, the candidates are exposed to the key documents of the Franciscan life: Sacred Scriptures, the writings by and about St. Francis, the Rule and Constitution of the Order, and the national and regional statutes which have been approved for use in individual countries. “They are trained in love for the Church and the acceptance of her teaching. The laity practice living their secular commitment in the world in an evangelical way”. (GC art. 40: 2)\n<br />\n<br />\nThe last line of article 40:2 is particularly important; here the members of the Secular Franciscan Order are invited to see the world and their place in the world against the horizon of the Gospel as they move from \"Gospel to life and life to the Gospel\" as the Rule challenges them to do. In this sense, \"evangelical\" means a way of life, which is imbued and guided by the Gospel and personal example of Jesus.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe important element of continuous conversion in the Franciscan life is strengthened in article 44 of the Constitution. <a href=\"http://www.ofsnational.ca/ND_Objectives_EN.asp\">Formation</a> is not a stage of preparation from which a secular graduates.

Thanks also to Madeleine Chaillé-St-Amant and her team; to Richard Casavant, to Richard Chamberland and his wife Micheline for having accepted to peruse over a section of the Manual.\n<br><br>\nI would like to thank also all those who, one way or another, have worked on this project.

Basis of Franciscan JPIC \nconcern and action</strong><br />\n\n<strong>The basis of Franciscan justice, peace and integrity of creation (JPIC)</strong><br />\nconcern and action is the Bible, Catholic Social Doctrine/Teaching, Franciscan Tradition and Spirituality, the OFS Rule and General Constitutions, reading the “signs of the times” and the Catholic Action model of “See, Judge, Act.” Franciscan values for 800 years have been: poverty, simplicity, humility, justice, peace, joy in God, universal brotherhood and kinship with creation.\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>An OFS Presence in the World</strong><br />\nIn March 2003, the International Council of the OFS (CIOFS) established the Presence in the World Commission (PIWC) to respond to the Conclusions of the 2002 General Chapter regarding the presence of Secular Franciscans in the world. This presence includes activity in the field of JPIC. The OFS General Chapter, 2008 in its’ conclusions stated: “For too long, the Order has not fully entered into its active mission in the world.  The moment has come, and it can no longer be deferred, to “enter the city,” to exercise with determination and full visibility its own responsibilities to witness, and to promote justice, peace, human rights and the integrity of creation”. \n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Parrhesia</strong> means to speak clearly and boldly without fear or hesitation. Benedetto Lino, ofs, (a CIOFS Presidency Councillor) wrote this about parrhesia recently: “Today, more than ever, we should ask the Lord for the grace of parrhesia, for each one of us, for the whole SFO [sic] and for our churches.” Parrhesia applies to all JPIC activity and especially to Franciscan Voice Canada (see below n. 8).\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>OFS Rule and General Constitutions</strong> <br />\nThe OFS Rule (nn.13-19) and the OFS General Constitutions (“For a Just and Fraternal Society” nn. 18-23) form the OFS basis of the JPIC “holy activity” mentioned by Our Seraphic Father Francis (Later Adm & Exhort 51-53).  The Rule and General Constitutions are in turn grounded on the basic principles of Catholic Social Doctrine e.g. human dignity; the common good; the preferential option for the poor; agápe/caritas/love and peace; solidarity; and the sacramentality, integrity and stewardship of creation\n</td>\n<td><strong>TRILLIUM REGIONAL FRATERNITY \n JUSTICE, PEACE AND INTEGRITY OF CREATION</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Franciscan Tradition and Spirituality</strong><br />\nFranciscan tradition and spirituality leads us to put life before profit, to struggle for justice and peace, and to care for creation. This is at the heart of our Franciscan charism, experience and holy activity. Francis and Clare refused to be bound by the values of a merchant society based on profit at the cost of the exploitation and marginalisation of the poor. Following the poor Jesus, they lead an alternative counter-cultural life based on solidarity with the lepers, the poor and the marginalised (the minores) and also with nature, a gift from God, with whom we have kinship as the Canticle of the Creatures and OFS Rule attest. We can say that Francis and Clare responded to the “Cry of the earth and Cry of the poor” and that they also discerned a “cry for peace” and sought right relationships and were peacemakers. \n<br />\n<br />\nStill today the enemies of justice, peace and good stewardship of creation are greed, lust for power and ignorance.

In addition, concerns of the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace (CCODP); The Catholic Near East Welfare Association (CNEWA); and the Canadian Religious Conference (CRC) were considered. Since their discernment involved reading the signs of the times it is no surprise that there is much convergence of concern. \n<br />\n<br />\nAs a result, and because it is impossible to address every issue that arises, the primary priorities it is adopted the National Fraternity should focus on are:\n<ol>\n<li>Extreme poverty and the excluded</li>\n<li>The ethical use of resources: especially water, mining and fair trade</li>\n<li>Food: security and sovereignty</li>\n<li>Human Trafficking and Contemporary Forms of Slavery</li>\n<li>Care of Creation: particularly one or more of the following: Pollution; Climate Change; the Alberta Oil Sands and/or Hydraulic fracturing</li>\n<li>Peace, conflict resolution and active non-violence</li>\n<li>Treatment of Refugees, Internally Displaced Persons and Migrants</li>\n<li>Solidarity with, and support for, Christians in countries threatened by hostile cultures</li>\n<li>Current issues regarding Aboriginal Peoples in Canada</li>\n<li>Other topics at the discretion of the fraternities.</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong>THE PROCESS:  SEE, ACT, JUDGE</strong><br />\nThe process for dealing with these issues is to take information, together with Catholic Social Doctrine/Teaching and Franciscan Tradition and spirituality, as the basis for continuing formation which must then lead to action. “See, judge, act” (to which we add “evaluate and celebrate”), is the Catholic Action model favoured by many Catholic organisations including the <a href=\"www.ofm.org\">OFM JPIC Office.</a>  \n<br />\n<br />\nLocal Fraternities are asked to consider this plan and these issues at a General Meeting. The fraternities are asked to decide which issue(s) their Fraternity will address to the extent that they are able and to select (elect or appoint) a JPIC Councillor to promote and animate JPIC in their Fraternity.

Our family is where God has placed us! How can we reach our children and grand children within our own families? By following Jesus and His words, by following our Rule as a Secular Franciscan and by living the Gospel, we are reaching out to our family\n<br />\n<br />\nA Secular Franciscan is called to a deeper service and love of others. We are called to help in the mission of “rebuilding” the Church. We are called to simplicity and joy. The Family is the little church – the home church - It stands to reason that building up families will help build up the Church.\n<br />\n<br />\nOur Franciscan Family, is a wonderful family to share!! We can begin by being inclusive whenever possible, with family events, playing games, going fishing, telling stories and sharing faith and meals, whenever possible, with our children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren and all the Lord may bring!\n<br />\n<br />\nJ<strong>esus shows us how to prioritize children as part of our mission of Love:</strong>\n“suffer the children to come to me and do not stop them”\nAnd “unless you become as a child you cannot enter the kingdom!”\nAnd, “better that a rock be tied around your neck and you be tossed into the sea, than what my Father will do to anyone who harms one of His little ones.”\nAnd then again let us hear Jesus: when one of the few things recorded that He spoke on the way to His death and in the midst of His suffering He found the strength to say to us, “Weep not for me but for yourselves and your children”,\n<br />\n<br />\nDo we weep for our children and our selves sometimes? Many families need our tears, prayers and help, today more than ever!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>St. Francis defined Evangelization</strong><br />\nFrancis said, “to evangelize a person, understand, is to say to him (her), “You also are loved by the Lord.” And not only to say it to him (her) but to truly think it, And not only to think it, but to behave with this person in such a manner that he(she) feels and discovers that there is in him (her) something saved, something greater and nobler than he(she) had thought! And so he (she) awakens to a new awareness of himself. That is what it means to announce the Good News.” (editor added in brackets)\n<br />\n<br />\nThis evangelization, taught by St. Francis is Beautiful and at the same time it is “radical.” Can we live this Evangelization with Children and Youth? Yes we can! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by telling stories of faith, parables, personal witness and life experiences, as the Holy Spirit leads us in our family gatherings! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by knowing the scriptures the Lord has said and what St. Francis has said. And we can reinforce these thoughts by praying for and with, our children and youth , sharing the prayers of the Church like the Rosary, experiencing Adoration and prayers from the heart.<br />\n<iframe width=\"342\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydytcpSEOwQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\nYes we can evangelize. We can build them up by being welcoming to our children and youth at family gatherings and maybe even in our fraternal gatherings offering a safe place to gather, creating some special times for celebrating and having fun! Giving our children and youth little roles of responsibility and allow them to help if they want to, gives an opportunity for them to respond to the good! Without pressure and this will help them feel valued! The Holy Spirit will guide us in living the Gospel with all we meet like St. Francis and St. Clare especially with the little souls entrusted to us in our families! You are not by chance related to that little child!\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>“special” he is... and so are all our children especially to the Lord!</li>\n<li>How about building a “mail box” for God and writing or drawing pictures to send to Him?</li>\n</lu>\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<strong>Practical Ideas:</strong><br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>In little things, remember, “bloom” where you are planted and in all things big or little things. What is happening in my parish with youth that I can help with? Is there something at the school I could do? Is there something at home?\nWhat am I or my Fraternity doing that could include family? Could we have a family potluck?</li>\n<li>Would my children, grand children, nieces, nephews, like it if I showed the cartoon of St. Francis or shared a colouring book?\nWhat craft or skill can I share with my children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins?</li>\n<li>How can I support my Parish Youth Group? Could I share “stories and prayers and activities” that show my Franciscan Charism?\nCan I be more “present” “love more” “listen better” Laugh longer with my family?</li>\n<li>Perhaps a little cleaning project, somewhere? Kids love to be active and to do things that are appreciated by others! My two year old grandson loves to hold my rosary and bless himself! He loves games and he likes helping his dad carry wood and helping “granny” wash dishes. When he helps with the windows, it makes more work for mommy and granny BUT he feels so good and happy it is worth it!! He feels “special” he is... and so are all our children especially to the Lord!</li>\n<li>How about building a “mail box” for God and writing or drawing pictures to send to Him?</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What comes to your mind?</strong><br />\nWe are already witnessing to children! We are the living book they see and hear! Do NOT be afraid but only listen to your heart and the Holy Spirit. The Lord will guide you in this most beautiful and precious part of our mission and family. There is no act of kindness that is too small! There is NO person too small! Who comes to mind right now? Who will be the first child or youth that God will place before me to share in a deeper way? Remember it is in the little things done in love that children grow into holy people! They say a child is formed by the age of 7 years. Remember that in the passing of 7 years, a 3 year old is now 10 years old. And then another 7 years and a 10 year old becomes 17. These are vital years of formation, because before you know it that 17 year old is an adult! Years go fast!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Important Note</strong><br />\nWhen working with Youth in your Parish be sure to follow the Guidelines in place by your local Parish or Diocese.

We can begin by being inclusive whenever possible, with family events, playing games, going fishing, telling stories and sharing faith and meals, whenever possible, with our children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren and all the Lord may bring!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jesus shows us how to prioritize children as part of our mission of Love:</strong>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>&quot;suffer the children to come to me and do not stop them&quot;</li>\n<li>And &quot;unless you become as a child you cannot enter the kingdom!&quot;</li>\n<li>And, &quot;better that a rock be tied around your neck and you be tossed into the sea, than what my Father will do to anyone who harms one of His little ones.&quot;</li>\n<li>And then again let us hear Jesus: when one of the few things recorded that He spoke on the way to His death and in the midst of His suffering He found the strength to say to us, &quot;Weep not for me but for yourselves and your children&quot;,</li>\n<br />\n<br />\nDo we weep for our children and our selves sometimes? Many families need our tears, prayers and help, today more than ever!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>St. Francis defined Evangelization</strong><br />\nFrancis said, “to evangelize a person, understand, is to say to him (her), “You also are loved by the Lord.” And not only to say it to him (her) but to truly think it, And not only to think it, but to behave with this person in such a manner that he(she) feels and discovers that there is in him (her) something saved, something greater and nobler than he(she) had thought! And so he (she) awakens to a new awareness of himself. That is what it means to announce the Good News.” (editor added in brackets)\n<br />\n<br />\nThis evangelization, taught by St. Francis is Beautiful and at the same time it is “radical.” Can we live this Evangelization with Children and Youth? Yes we can! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by telling stories of faith, parables, personal witness and life experiences, as the Holy Spirit leads us in our family gatherings! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by knowing the scriptures the Lord has said and what St. Francis has said. And we can reinforce these thoughts by praying for and with, our children and youth , sharing the prayers of the Church like the Rosary, experiencing Adoration and prayers from the heart.<br />\n<iframe width=\"342\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydytcpSEOwQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\nYes we can evangelize. We can build them up by being welcoming to our children and youth at family gatherings and maybe even in our fraternal gatherings offering a safe place to gather, creating some special times for celebrating and having fun! Giving our children and youth little roles of responsibility and allow them to help if they want to, gives an opportunity for them to respond to the good! Without pressure and this will help them feel valued! The Holy Spirit will guide us in living the Gospel with all we meet like St. Francis and St. Clare especially with the little souls entrusted to us in our families! You are not by chance related to that little child!\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>“special” he is... and so are all our children especially to the Lord!</li>\n<li>How about building a “mail box” for God and writing or drawing pictures to send to Him?</li>\n</lu>\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<strong>Practical Ideas:</strong><br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>In little things, remember, “bloom” where you are planted and in all things big or little things. What is happening in my parish with youth that I can help with? Is there something at the school I could do? Is there something at home?\nWhat am I or my Fraternity doing that could include family? Could we have a family potluck?</li>\n<li>Would my children, grand children, nieces, nephews, like it if I showed the cartoon of St. Francis or shared a colouring book?\nWhat craft or skill can I share with my children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins?</li>\n<li>How can I support my Parish Youth Group? Could I share “stories and prayers and activities” that show my Franciscan Charism?\nCan I be more “present” “love more” “listen better” Laugh longer with my family?</li>\n<li>Perhaps a little cleaning project, somewhere? Kids love to be active and to do things that are appreciated by others! My two year old grandson loves to hold my rosary and bless himself! He loves games and he likes helping his dad carry wood and helping “granny” wash dishes. When he helps with the windows, it makes more work for mommy and granny BUT he feels so good and happy it is worth it!! He feels “special” he is... and so are all our children especially to the Lord!</li>\n<li>How about building a “mail box” for God and writing or drawing pictures to send to Him?</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What comes to your mind?</strong><br />\nWe are already witnessing to children! We are the living book they see and hear! Do NOT be afraid but only listen to your heart and the Holy Spirit. The Lord will guide you in this most beautiful and precious part of our mission and family. There is no act of kindness that is too small! There is NO person too small! Who comes to mind right now? Who will be the first child or youth that God will place before me to share in a deeper way? Remember it is in the little things done in love that children grow into holy people! They say a child is formed by the age of 7 years. Remember that in the passing of 7 years, a 3 year old is now 10 years old. And then another 7 years and a 10 year old becomes 17. These are vital years of formation, because before you know it that 17 year old is an adult! Years go fast!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Important Note</strong><br />\nWhen working with Youth in your Parish be sure to follow the Guidelines in place by your local Parish or Diocese. Most ministry and volunteer work, that is with those most vulnerable, i.e. the young and the old, require a CPIC (Police Criminal Record Check ) When the work is volunteer, there is usually no costs related to this.<br /><br />\n<iframe width=\"330\" height=\"215\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwPwLTs-ze4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong>FRANCISCAN \nYOUNG ADULTS\nVISIT OUR YOUFRA PAGE</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Brochure & Handouts \n2013-2014 \nPrayer Program and \nResources Page, \nclick below on the downloads provided</strong><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Resource-Page.pdf\">Resource Page</a><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/youfra_brochure.pdf\">Youfra Brochure</a><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YouFra-Handout.pdf\">YouFra Handout</a><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YouFra-Prayer.pdf\">YouFra Prayer</a><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Resources.pdf\">Additional Resources</a><br /><br />\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[FYEN] Franciscan Youth Program','','inherit','closed','closed','','161-revision-v1','','','2020-10-12 19:32:03','2020-10-12 23:32:03','',161,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/10/12/161-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(569,1,'2020-10-12 19:35:30','2020-10-12 23:35:30','','YouFra One','','inherit','','closed','','youfra-one','','','2020-10-12 19:35:30','2020-10-12 23:35:30','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/YouFra-One.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(570,1,'2020-10-12 19:40:10','2020-10-12 23:40:10','','youfraformation','','inherit','','closed','','youfraformation','','','2020-10-12 19:40:10','2020-10-12 23:40:10','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/youfraformation.pdf',0,'attachment','application/pdf',0),(571,1,'2020-10-12 19:41:30','2020-10-12 23:41:30','','franciscanyouthinterreg','','inherit','','closed','','franciscanyouthinterreg','','','2020-10-12 19:41:30','2020-10-12 23:41:30','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/franciscanyouthinterreg.pdf',0,'attachment','application/pdf',0),(572,1,'2020-10-12 19:41:59','2020-10-12 23:41:59','','formationreligiousguidelines','','inherit','','closed','','formationreligiousguidelines','','','2020-10-12 19:41:59','2020-10-12 23:41:59','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/formationreligiousguidelines.pdf',0,'attachment','application/pdf',0),(573,1,'2020-10-12 19:43:00','2020-10-12 23:43:00','','1interyoufrabarcelona2007','','inherit','','closed','','1interyoufrabarcelona2007','','','2020-10-12 19:43:00','2020-10-12 23:43:00','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1interyoufrabarcelona2007.pdf',0,'attachment','application/pdf',0),(574,1,'2020-10-12 19:43:51','2020-10-12 23:43:51','','youfrasfo','','inherit','','closed','','youfrasfo','','','2020-10-12 19:43:51','2020-10-12 23:43:51','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/youfrasfo.pdf',0,'attachment','application/pdf',0),(575,1,'2020-10-12 19:44:30','2020-10-12 23:44:30','','youfravocation','','inherit','','closed','','youfravocation','','','2020-10-12 19:44:30','2020-10-12 23:44:30','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/youfravocation.pdf',0,'attachment','application/pdf',0),(576,1,'2020-10-12 19:48:12','2020-10-12 23:48:12','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Young Adults YOUFRA</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<strong>“Gospel living as modeled by St. Francis of Assisi”  Is God Calling You to Journey with St. Francis?</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\nYOUFRA\nYouFra is a journey of Franciscan Spirituality for young people attracted by the life of St Francis of Assisi and who seek to deepen their life with God, their understanding of self, of others and the exceptional beauty of creation.

We make haste to discover new treasures on our way. Is it not in Assisi where we find St Francis\' joy and love? Listen to the whistling of the air through the trees, these peaceful sounds speak, of heaven above.\nOur feet pound the pavement, muscles burn from contracting; we are climbing the soft stone streets of this city. Hearts beating warmly from so many scenes attracting. Gazing downward from this mountain green with vegetation,\nfarmers plow their fields as the earth is waiting to be worked in. All the shades of green arranged in God\'s good presentation. Mountains line the horizon with a bluish stare. Beyond these heights is God\'s power, in awe our souls become aware. The air covers the mountains and lines them with mist. The sky is pastel blue and broad, light radiates through the clouds, in a way one can\'t resist. O Assisi, precious home of my saint, your creation moves me softly, with pictures I could never paint. I praise you Lord God, for this beautiful creation!\nI\'m thankful to be able to see St Francis\' inspiration.\n<br />\n<img src=\"\" />\n<strong>Second Reflection: Letter from Caitlynn Rainey</strong>\n <br />\n <br />\nDear friends,\nOur trip to Assisi was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. Not only did we get to learn a lot about the life of St. Francis, but we had the chance to make life long friendships with people from around the world.\n <br />\n <br />\nExperiencing the Italian culture was full of surprises as we ate and drank like pure Italians, and admired the beautiful surroundings wherever we traveled to. Our journey to Italy allowed me to find peace within myself, discover who I really am, and become closer to God.  Everyday we had the chance to think about and pray for our intentions, and having the feeling that we were so closely connected to God was just incredible. Being there for one week made it possible to socialize and take part in social activities with other countries, as we built trusting friendships with them.\n <br />\n <br />\nIf I had to choose my most favorite part about the trip, I don\'t think I could because everyday was filled with new and exciting experiences that enlightened my life.\n <br />\n <br />\nSincerely, <br />\nCaitlynn Rainey  <br />\nBracebridge, Ontario. <br />\n<br />\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\"></td>\n<td width=\"33%\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[YAEN] Young Adults YOUFRA','','inherit','closed','closed','','164-revision-v1','','','2020-10-12 19:48:12','2020-10-12 23:48:12','',164,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/10/12/164-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(578,1,'2020-10-13 12:53:48','2020-10-13 16:53:48','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>JPIC Issues &amp; Resources</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong>JPIC KEY ISSUES</strong><br>\nThe National JPIC Commission has reviewed the issues of concern to the other branches of the Franciscan family (e.g. the OFM JPIC office; Franciscans International (FI); Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land; the Francophone Franciscan Family of Canada’s  Service intercommunautaire d’animation  franciscaine (SIAF).

Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by knowing the scriptures the Lord has said and what St. Francis has said.

They say a child is formed by the age of 7 years. Remember that in the passing of 7 years, a 3 year old is now 10 years old. And then another 7 years and a 10 year old becomes 17.

The Family is the little church – the home church - It stands to reason that building up families will help build up the Church.\n<br />\n<br />\nOur Franciscan Family, is a wonderful family to share!! We can begin by being inclusive whenever possible, with family events, playing games, going fishing, telling stories and sharing faith and meals, whenever possible, with our children, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren and all the Lord may bring!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jesus shows us how to prioritize children as part of our mission of Love:</strong>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>&quot;suffer the children to come to me and do not stop them&quot;</li>\n<li>And &quot;unless you become as a child you cannot enter the kingdom!&quot;</li>\n<li>And, &quot;better that a rock be tied around your neck and you be tossed into the sea, than what my Father will do to anyone who harms one of His little ones.&quot;</li>\n<li>And then again let us hear Jesus: when one of the few things recorded that He spoke on the way to His death and in the midst of His suffering He found the strength to say to us, &quot;Weep not for me but for yourselves and your children&quot;,</li>\n<br />\n<br />\nDo we weep for our children and our selves sometimes? Many families need our tears, prayers and help, today more than ever!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>St. Francis defined Evangelization</strong><br />\nFrancis said, “to evangelize a person, understand, is to say to him (her), “You also are loved by the Lord.” And not only to say it to him (her) but to truly think it, And not only to think it, but to behave with this person in such a manner that he(she) feels and discovers that there is in him (her) something saved, something greater and nobler than he(she) had thought! And so he (she) awakens to a new awareness of himself. That is what it means to announce the Good News.” (editor added in brackets)\n<br />\n<br />\nThis evangelization, taught by St. Francis is Beautiful and at the same time it is “radical.” Can we live this Evangelization with Children and Youth? Yes we can! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by telling stories of faith, parables, personal witness and life experiences, as the Holy Spirit leads us in our family gatherings! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by knowing the scriptures the Lord has said and what St. Francis has said. And we can reinforce these thoughts by praying for and with, our children and youth , sharing the prayers of the Church like the Rosary, experiencing Adoration and prayers from the heart.<br />\n<iframe width=\"342\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydytcpSEOwQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\nYes we can evangelize.

Who will be the first child or youth that God will place before me to share in a deeper way? Remember it is in the little things done in love that children grow into holy people! They say a child is formed by the age of 7 years. Remember that in the passing of 7 years, a 3 year old is now 10 years old. And then another 7 years and a 10 year old becomes 17. These are vital years of formation, because before you know it that 17 year old is an adult!

They say a child is formed by the age of 7 years. Remember that in the passing of 7 years, a 3 year old is now 10 years old. And then another 7 years and a 10 year old becomes 17.

In the Early Rule of 1221 for the Friars, Francis wrote these words: \n<br>\n<br>\n“Within our hearts we must make a home and dwelling place for God our Lord, the almighty Father, the Son and Holy Spirit. God is always near us, and in prayer we consciously think of God, we place ourselves in his presence. Francis tells us it is the opposite. We must make a presence - a home for God in our hearts so that we may carry him with us always.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nThere is an interesting reflection on making a home, a dwelling place for God. \n<br>\n<br>\nLuke 11:24-26 When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest; and finding none he says, `I will return to my house from which I came.\' And when he comes he finds it swept and put in order. Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.\n<br>\n<br>\nFrancis reminds us that It is not good enough to just banish evil thoughts and habits, “to hate ones body with its vice” as he says in his Letter to all the Faithful. It isn’t sufficient to just clean one’s house. We must also fill the void with God who is the source of all that is good and upright. We must make a home and dwelling place for God.\n<br>\n<br>\nFranciscan Spirituality is centred on three key mysteries of our Faith. These mysteries Francis meditated on frequently. They are the Incarnation, the Paschal Mystery and the Eucharist.

This presence includes activity in the field of JPIC. The OFS General Chapter, 2008 in its’ conclusions stated: “For too long, the Order has not fully entered into its active mission in the world.  The moment has come, and it can no longer be deferred, to “enter the city,” to exercise with determination and full visibility its own responsibilities to witness, and to promote justice, peace, human rights and the integrity of creation”. \n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Parrhesia</strong> means to speak clearly and boldly without fear or hesitation. Benedetto Lino, ofs, (a CIOFS Presidency Councillor) wrote this about parrhesia recently: “Today, more than ever, we should ask the Lord for the grace of parrhesia, for each one of us, for the whole SFO [sic] and for our churches.” Parrhesia applies to all JPIC activity and especially to Franciscan Voice Canada (see below n. 8).\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>OFS Rule and General Constitutions</strong> <br>\nThe OFS Rule (nn.13-19) and the OFS General Constitutions (“For a Just and Fraternal Society” nn. 18-23) form the OFS basis of the JPIC “holy activity” mentioned by Our Seraphic Father Francis (Later Adm &amp; Exhort 51-53).  The Rule and General Constitutions are in turn grounded on the basic principles of Catholic Social Doctrine e.g. human dignity; the common good; the preferential option for the poor; agápe/caritas/love and peace; solidarity; and the sacramentality, integrity and stewardship of creation\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\"><strong>TRILLIUM REGIONAL FRATERNITY \n JUSTICE, PEACE AND INTEGRITY OF CREATION</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Franciscan Tradition and Spirituality</strong><br>\nFranciscan tradition and spirituality leads us to put life before profit, to struggle for justice and peace, and to care for creation. This is at the heart of our Franciscan charism, experience and holy activity. Francis and Clare refused to be bound by the values of a merchant society based on profit at the cost of the exploitation and marginalisation of the poor. Following the poor Jesus, they lead an alternative counter-cultural life based on solidarity with the lepers, the poor and the marginalised (the minores) and also with nature, a gift from God, with whom we have kinship as the Canticle of the Creatures and OFS Rule attest. We can say that Francis and Clare responded to the “Cry of the earth and Cry of the poor” and that they also discerned a “cry for peace” and sought right relationships and were peacemakers. \n<br>\n<br>\nStill today the enemies of justice, peace and good stewardship of creation are greed, lust for power and ignorance. To emulate Francis and Clare currently requires concrete choices and action in a commercially globalised world. Implementation of this JPIC Action Plan will lead to contemporary ways in which we can follow Francis and Clare in a practical and concrete manner.\nThe OFS, in order to follow the Rule, has a prophetic mission to make it a priority in its’ fraternal and individuals’ lives to raise their own and others’ awareness of, and act for, JPIC.  Our JPIC plans and actions should reflect our belief that in addressing systemic injustice, which is the root cause of so much poverty and pain in our world, we will bring hope and positive change into the lives of those who suffer most.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe need to understand the link between faith, charity, justice and stewardship; to develop the habit of analysis of political, social and economic issues (see, judge and act) in light of the social doctrine of the church in order to arrive at clear conclusions; and to take pertinent action ourselves and in collaboration with partner organizations and especially to advocate for the voiceless and un-empowered (the minores).</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong>JPIC Resources</strong><br><br>\n<a href=\"/index.php/en/jpic-issues-resources/\">JPIC Resources</a><br><br>\n<strong>GREAT SOURCES FOR Resources, Issues and Materials contact:</strong><br><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.franciscanvoicecanada.com/\">FRANCISCAN VOICE CANADA</a><br><br><br>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/35Hmgn5mTGs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[SJEN] Social Justice JPIC','','inherit','closed','closed','','75-revision-v1','','','2020-10-14 11:55:49','2020-10-14 15:55:49','',75,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/10/14/75-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(683,1,'2020-10-14 12:02:14','2020-10-14 16:02:14','','JPIC_Communique_October_2020','','inherit','','closed','','jpic_communique_october_2020','','','2020-10-14 12:02:14','2020-10-14 16:02:14','',0,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/JPIC_Communique_October_2020.pdf',0,'attachment','application/pdf',0),(684,1,'2020-10-14 12:03:17','2020-10-14 16:03:17','<h1>Welcome To The Trillium Regional Fraternity Website</h1>\n<p class=\"main\">This website was created by the Trillium Regional Council of the<br>Secular Franciscans in Ontario, Canada.

Aspects that are essential in the first phase, <strong>ORIENTATION</strong> will still be essential in the second, <strong>INQUIRY</strong> the third, <strong>CANDIDACY</strong> and into the <a \n href=\"http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/en/fpen-formation-process/\">Ongoing Formation</a> of <strong>PROFESSED MEMBERS</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\nThe Secular Franciscan Order, as all religious orders, has its <a href=\"https://secularfranciscansusa.org/the-rule-of-the-secular-franciscan-order/\">Rule</a> and General Constitution, the charism of the founders and the mission give to it by the Church. Our current Rule was approved by Pope Paul VI on June 24,1978.\n<br />\n<br />\nMembership in the Secular Franciscan Order is achieved through a journey, a time of formation. During the formative period candidates are invited to search out the will of God for them through study, prayer and reflection. The Fraternity provides an environment in which candidates experience more deeply the evangelical life, establish fraternal relationships and find ways for a more fruitful involvement in the life and the mission of the Church.\n<br />\n<br />\nIn Fraternities formation is \"carried out with frequent meetings for study and prayer and with concrete experiences of service and of apostolate\" (GC art. 40:1). During formation, the candidates are exposed to the key documents of the Franciscan life: Sacred Scriptures, the writings by and about St. Francis, the Rule and Constitution of the Order, and the national and regional statutes which have been approved for use in individual countries. “They are trained in love for the Church and the acceptance of her teaching. The laity practice living their secular commitment in the world in an evangelical way”. (GC art. 40: 2)\n<br />\n<br />\nThe last line of article 40:2 is particularly important; here the members of the Secular Franciscan Order are invited to see the world and their place in the world against the horizon of the Gospel as they move from \"Gospel to life and life to the Gospel\" as the Rule challenges them to do. In this sense, \"evangelical\" means a way of life, which is imbued and guided by the Gospel and personal example of Jesus.\n<br />\n<br />\nThe important element of continuous conversion in the Franciscan life is strengthened in article 44 of the Constitution. <a href=\"http://www.ofsnational.ca/ND_Objectives_EN.asp\">Formation</a> is not a stage of preparation from which a secular graduates. It is rather an invitation to a way of life in which one works toward spiritual growth and maturity.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"960\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/orexgZBj4As\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<!-- /wp:html -->','[PUEN] Purpose','','inherit','closed','closed','','136-autosave-v1','','','2020-10-14 12:23:02','2020-10-14 16:23:02','',136,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/10/14/136-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(695,1,'2020-10-14 12:25:47','2020-10-14 16:25:47','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Newsletter</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p>The official Newsletter of the Secular Franciscan Order, Trillium Region, is the \n<br /><br />\n<h2>Good News Report</h2>\n<br /><br />\nWe aim to publish in the middle to the end of September, December,\n March and June.\n<br /><br />\nThrough the vehicle of this newsletter the Minister and members of the Trillium Council hope to keep all Secular Franciscans in the Region aware of activities promoted by the Region, and of new information coming from the National and International Fraternities.

And so he (she) awakens to a new awareness of himself. That is what it means to announce the Good News.” (editor added in brackets)\n<br />\n<br />\nThis evangelization, taught by St. Francis is Beautiful and at the same time it is “radical.” Can we live this Evangelization with Children and Youth? Yes we can! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by telling stories of faith, parables, personal witness and life experiences, as the Holy Spirit leads us in our family gatherings! Yes we can evangelize! We can build them up by knowing the scriptures the Lord has said and what St. Francis has said. And we can reinforce these thoughts by praying for and with, our children and youth , sharing the prayers of the Church like the Rosary, experiencing Adoration and prayers from the heart.<br />\n<iframe width=\"342\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydytcpSEOwQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\nYes we can evangelize. We can build them up by being welcoming to our children and youth at family gatherings and maybe even in our fraternal gatherings offering a safe place to gather, creating some special times for celebrating and having fun! Giving our children and youth little roles of responsibility and allow them to help if they want to, gives an opportunity for them to respond to the good! Without pressure and this will help them feel valued! The Holy Spirit will guide us in living the Gospel with all we meet like St. Francis and St. Clare especially with the little souls entrusted to us in our families! You are not by chance related to that little child!\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>“special” he is... and so are all our children especially to the Lord!</li>\n<li>How about building a “mail box” for God and writing or drawing pictures to send to Him?</li>\n</lu>\n<br />\n<br />\n\n<strong>Practical Ideas:</strong><br />\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\n<li>In little things, remember, “bloom” where you are planted and in all things big or little things. What is happening in my parish with youth that I can help with? Is there something at the school I could do? Is there something at home?\nWhat am I or my Fraternity doing that could include family? Could we have a family potluck?</li>\n<li>Would my children, grand children, nieces, nephews, like it if I showed the cartoon of St. Francis or shared a colouring book?\nWhat craft or skill can I share with my children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins?</li>\n<li>How can I support my Parish Youth Group? Could I share “stories and prayers and activities” that show my Franciscan Charism?\nCan I be more “present” “love more” “listen better” Laugh longer with my family?</li>\n<li>Perhaps a little cleaning project, somewhere? Kids love to be active and to do things that are appreciated by others! My two year old grandson loves to hold my rosary and bless himself! He loves games and he likes helping his dad carry wood and helping “granny” wash dishes. When he helps with the windows, it makes more work for mommy and granny BUT he feels so good and happy it is worth it!! He feels “special” he is... and so are all our children especially to the Lord!</li>\n<li>How about building a “mail box” for God and writing or drawing pictures to send to Him?</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What comes to your mind?</strong><br />\nWe are already witnessing to children! We are the living book they see and hear! Do NOT be afraid but only listen to your heart and the Holy Spirit. The Lord will guide you in this most beautiful and precious part of our mission and family. There is no act of kindness that is too small! There is NO person too small! Who comes to mind right now? Who will be the first child or youth that God will place before me to share in a deeper way? Remember it is in the little things done in love that children grow into holy people! They say a child is formed by the age of 7 years. Remember that in the passing of 7 years, a 3 year old is now 10 years old. And then another 7 years and a 10 year old becomes 17. These are vital years of formation, because before you know it that 17 year old is an adult! Years go fast!\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Important Note</strong><br />\nWhen working with Youth in your Parish be sure to follow the Guidelines in place by your local Parish or Diocese. Most ministry and volunteer work, that is with those most vulnerable, i.e. the young and the old, require a CPIC (Police Criminal Record Check ) When the work is volunteer, there is usually no costs related to this.<br /><br />\n<iframe width=\"330\" height=\"215\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwPwLTs-ze4\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</td>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong> \nYOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS\nVISIT OUR YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS PAGE</strong>\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Brochure & Handouts, \nPrayer Program and \nResources Page \n</strong><br /><br />\nRESOURCES\n<br>\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Resource-Page.pdf\">Tools for Evangelizing Youth and Young Adults</a><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/youfra_brochure.pdf\">Youfra Brochure</a><br /><br />\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/A-Prayer-for-Youth.pdf\">An OFS Prayer for Youth</a><br/>\n<br>\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Prayer-Intentions-for-OFS-and-Youfra-2020.pdf\">Monthly Prayer Intentions 2020 for OFS and Youfra</a><br/><br>\n<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Resources.pdf\">Additional Resources</a><br /><br />\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','[FYEN] Franciscan Youth Program','','inherit','closed','closed','','161-revision-v1','','','2020-10-19 10:49:31','2020-10-19 14:49:31','',161,'http://local.trilliumregionalofs.com/index.php/2020/10/19/161-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(754,1,'2020-10-19 10:51:57','2020-10-19 14:51:57','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h1>Franciscan Youth Program</h1>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"33%\">\n<strong>Secular Franciscans, Youth and Young Adults/strong>\nWe are all family and we all have families!
